	abstract = {This study presents the results from the Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis version 2 (TCR-2) for the period 2005–2018 at 1.1∘ horizontal resolution obtained from the assimilation of multiple updated satellite measurements of ozone, CO, NO2, HNO3, and SO2 from the OMI, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, TES, MLS, and MOPITT satellite instruments. The reanalysis calculation was conducted using a global chemical transport model MIROC-CHASER and an ensemble Kalman filter technique that optimizes both chemical concentrations of various species and emissions of several precursors, which was efficient for the correction of the entire tropospheric profile of various species and its year-to-year variations. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite, and ozonesonde observations demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis fields for numerous key species on regional and global scales, as well as for seasonal, yearly, and decadal scales, from the surface to the lower stratosphere. The multi-constituent data assimilation brought the model vertical profiles and interhemispheric gradient of OH closer to observational estimates, which was important in improving the description of the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and thus vertical profiles of various species. The evaluation results demonstrate the capability of the chemical reanalysis to improve understanding of the processes controlling variations in atmospheric composition, including long-term changes in near-surface air quality and emissions. The estimated emissions can be employed for the elucidation of detailed distributions of the anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions of co-emitted species (NOx, CO, SO2) in all major regions, as well as their seasonal and decadal variabilities. The data sets are available at https://doi.org/10.25966/9qgv-fe81 (Miyazaki et al., 2019a).},

	abstract = {In recent years, ground-level ozone has become a severe ambient pollutant in major urban areas of China, which has adverse impacts on population health. However, in-situ measurements of the ozone concentration before 2013 in China are quite scarce, which cannot facilitate the assessment of the long-term trends and effects of ozone pollution. In this study, we used daily maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) ozone observations from 2013 to 2017 combined with concurrent ozone retrievals, aerosol reanalysis, meteorological parameters, and land-use data to establish a nationwide MDA8 prediction model based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. The model achieves high prediction accuracy compared with other studies, with R2 values for the by-year, site-based, and sample-based cross-validation (CV) schemes of 0.61, 0.64, and 0.78, respectively, at the daily level. External testing with regional measurements from 2005 to 2012 and nationwide data in 2018 have shown that the model is robust and reliable for historical data prediction, with external model testing R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.87 at the month level in different years. Using the final estimator, we obtained nationwide monthly mean ozone concentrations from 2005 to 2012 and daily MDA8 ozone concentrations from 2013 to 2017 at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°. According to the average number of days exceeding the standard and the average of the 90th percentile of the MDA8 ozone concentrations, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Jianghan Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Northeast Plain regions were identified as pollution hotspots. During the research period, the overall ozone levels fluctuated slightly, and their trends were not spatially continuous. There was a significant increasing trend in the BTH region by 1.37 (95\% CI: 0.46,2.29) μg/m3/year between 2013 and 2017. In 2017, 26.24\% of the population lived in areas exceeding the Chinese grade II national air quality standard, which shows that ozone pollution has posed an obvious threat to population health in China. Our products will provide reliable support for future long-term nationwide health impact studies and policy-making for pollution control and prevention.},

	abstract = {Starting from 2021, more demanding NOx emission restrictions were introduced for ships operating in the North and Baltic Sea waters. Since all methods currently used for ship compliance monitoring are financially and time demanding, it is important to prioritize the inspection of ships that have high chances of being non-compliant. The current state-of-the-art approach for a large-scale ship NO2 estimation is a supervised machine learning-based segmentation of ship plumes on TROPOMI/S5P images. However, challenging data annotation and insufficiently complex ship emission proxy used for the validation limit the applicability of the model for ship compliance monitoring. In this study, we present a methodology towards the automated and scalable selection of potentially non-compliant ships using a combination of machine learning models on TROPOMI satellite data. It is based on a proposed regression model predicting the amount of NO2 that is expected to be produced by a ship with certain properties operating in the given atmospheric conditions. The model does not require manual labeling and is validated with TROPOMI data directly. The differences between the predicted and actual amount of produced NO2 are integrated over observations of the ship in time and are used as a measure of the inspection worthiness of a ship. To add further evidence, we compare the obtained results with the results of the previously developed segmentation-based method. Ships that are also highly deviating in accordance with the segmentation method require further attention. If no other explanations can be found by checking the TROPOMI data, the respective ships are advised to be the candidates for inspection.},

This approach allows us to exploit efficiently the growing volume of satellite data available to characterize Earth’s climate. For the purposes of demonstration, we focus on data collected between July 2018 and June 2020. We train the deep learning model using six thousand 28 × 28 pixel images of TROPOMI data (corresponding to ≃ 266 km × 133 km) and find that the model can identify plumes with a success rate of more than 90 \%. Over our study period, we find over 310 000 individual NO2 plumes, of which ≃ 19 \% are found over mainland China. We have attempted to remove the influence of open biomass burning using correlative high-resolution thermal infrared data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We relate the remaining NO2 plumes to large urban centres, oil and gas production, and major power plants. We find no correlation between NO2 plumes and the location of natural gas flaring. We also find persistent NO2 plumes from regions where inventories do not currently include emissions. Using an established anthropogenic CO2 emission inventory, we find that our NO2 plume distribution captures 92 \% of total CO2 emissions, with the remaining 8 \% mostly due to a large number of small sources (\&lt; 0.2 g C m−2 d−1) to which our NO2 plume model is less sensitive. We argue that the underlying CNN approach could form the basis of a Bayesian framework to estimate anthropogenic combustion emissions.},

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of biomass burning emissions has played a crucial role in air quality and climate forecast modeling. Satellite-based fire radiative power (FRP) has proven effective for calculating biomass burning emissions. However, FRP-based emission estimations in East Asia often rely on polar-orbiting satellites owing to the unstable performance of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Himawari Imager (JAXA AHI) from poor detection capability and unproper FRP retrieval method. To address this, we improve the FRP by machine learning based on mid-infrared (MIR) radiance method, leveraging the superior fire detection model developed in our previous study. In addition, we propose a multi-satellite distance-based weighted ensemble FRP estimation method. Compared to traditional MIR radiance methods, the machine learning-based FRP estimation model exhibited promising performance (correlation coefficient: 1, mean bias error: 0.2, mean absolute percentage error: 1.9\%). The integration of machine learning-based FRP estimation and fire detection model dramatically mitigated the underestimation issues from the JAXA AHI. The machine learning-based FRP was combined with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer FRP to create a multi-satellite ensemble FRP. Comparative assessments using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument and conventional bottom-up method demonstrated that the proposed method produced reliable output. Furthermore, impact analysis revealed that missing peaks or underestimated burn scars could lead to fatally low emissions; however, the proposed method was relatively robust against missing data owing to its multi-satellite ensemble. By identifying potential FRP problems and their impact on emission estimations, this study provides valuable insights for FRP-based emission estimation studies.},

	abstract = {Current methods for detecting atmospheric plumes and inferring point-source rates from high-resolution satellite imagery are labor-intensive and not scalable with regard to the growing satellite dataset available for methane point sources. Here, we present a two-step algorithm called U-Plume for automated detection and quantification of point sources from satellite imagery. The first step delivers plume detection and delineation (masking) with a U-Net machine learning architecture for image segmentation. The second step quantifies the point-source rate from the masked plume using wind speed information and either a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a physics-based integrated mass enhancement (IME) method. The algorithm can process 62 images (each measuring 128 pixels × 128 pixels) per second on a single 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7-9750H CPU. We train the algorithm using large-eddy simulations of methane plumes superimposed on noisy and variable methane background scenes from the GHGSat-C1 satellite instrument. We introduce the concept of point-source observability, Ops=Q/(UWΔB), as a single dimensionless number to predict plume detectability and source rate quantification error from an instrument as a function of source rate Q, wind speed U, instrument pixel size W, and instrument-dependent background noise ΔB. We show that Ops can powerfully diagnose the ability of an imaging instrument to observe point sources of a certain magnitude under given conditions. U-Plume successfully detects and masks plumes from sources as small as 100 kg h−1 in GHGSat-C1 images over surfaces with low background noise and successfully handles larger point sources over surfaces with substantial background noise. We find that the IME method for source quantification is unbiased over the full range of source rates, while the CNN method is biased towards the mean of its training range. The total error in source rate quantification is dominated by wind speed at low wind speeds and by the masking algorithm at high wind speeds. A wind speed of 2–4 m s−1 is optimal for detection and quantification of point sources from satellite data.},

	abstract = {Tremendous efforts have been made to construct large-scale estimates of aerosol components. However, Black Carbon (BC) estimates over large spatiotemporal scales are still limited. We proposed a novel approach utilizing machine-learning techniques to estimate BC on a large scale. We leveraged a comprehensive gridded BC emission database and auxiliary variables as inputs to train various machine learning (ML) models, specifically a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, to estimate high spatiotemporal BC concentration over China. Different ML algorithms have been applied to a large number of potential datasets and detailed variable importance and sensitivity analysis have also been carried out to explore the physical relevance of variables on the BC estimation model. RF algorithm showed the best performance compared with other ML models. Good predictive performance was observed for the training cases (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.37 μgm−3) and test case databases (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.35 μgm−3) on a daily time scale, illustrating a significant improvement compared to previous studies with remote sensing and chemical transport models. The seasonal variation of BC distributions was also evaluated, with the best performance observed in spring and summer (R2 ≈ 0.7–0.76, RMSE ≈ 0.98–1.26 μgm−3), followed by autumn and winter (R2 ≈ 0.7–0.72, RMSE ≈ 1.37–1.63 μgm−3). Variable importance and sensitivity analysis illustrated that the BC emission inventories and meteorology showed the highest importance in estimating BC concentration (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 1.88 μgm−3). At the same time, albedo data and some land cover type variables were also helpful in improving the model performance. We demonstrated that the emission-based ML model with an appropriate auxiliary database (e.g., satellite and reanalysis datasets) could effectively estimate the spatiotemporal BC concentrations at a large scale. In addition, the promising results obtained through this approach highlight its potential to be utilized for the assessment of other primary pollutants in the future.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2 emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018–June 2022) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and yields a total emission rate of 1.09×1026 molec. s−1. The ML-trained anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R2 value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1.99×1025 molec. s−1 is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory.

 Weekly variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced by 16 \% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction estimate of 28 \% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21 \% in March–June 2020 in Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities. Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions. However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further reduce the uncertainty budget.},

The satellite-based top-down method can provide near-real-time constraints on emissions; however, its efficiency is largely limited by efforts in dealing with the complex emission–concentration response. Here, we propose a novel machine-learning-based method using a physically informed variational autoencoder (VAE) emission predictor to infer NOx emissions from satellite-retrieved surface NO2 concentrations. The computational burden can be significantly reduced with the help of a neural network trained with a chemical transport model, allowing the VAE emission predictor to provide a timely estimation of posterior emissions based on the satellite-retrieved surface NO2 concentration. The VAE emission predictor successfully corrected the underestimation of NOx emissions in rural areas and the overestimation in urban areas, resulting in smaller normalized mean biases (reduced from −0.8 to −0.4) and larger R2 values (increased from 0.4 to 0.7). The interpretability of the VAE emission predictor was investigated using sensitivity analysis by modulating each feature, indicating that NO2 concentration and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height are important for estimating NOx emissions, which is consistent with our common knowledge. The advantages of the VAE emission predictor in efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy demonstrate its great potential in estimating the latest emissions and evaluating the control effectiveness from observations.},

Estimating GHG emissions using atmospheric observations is typically done using source-receptor relationships (i.e., "footprints''). \&nbsp;Constructing these footprints can be computationally expensive and is rapidly becoming a computational bottleneck for studying GHG fluxes at high spatio-temporal resolution using dense observations. \&nbsp;Here we demonstrate a computationally efficient GHG flux inversion framework using a machine learning emulator for atmospheric transport (FootNet) as a surrogate for the full-physics model. The footprints generated by FootNet are at approximately one-kilometer resolution. We update the architecture of the deep-learning model to improve the performance in a GHG flux inversion. \&nbsp;Paradoxically, the updated FootNet model out-performs the full-physics model when used in a flux inversion and compared against independent observations. This improved performance is likely because atmospheric transport simulated with a full-physics transport model is not necessarily more accurate. The more simplistic representation of transport in the machine learning model helps to mitigate transport errors. This flux inversion using a machine learning surrogate model only requires meteorological data, GHG measurements, and prior fluxes. Constructing footprints using FootNet is 650\&times; faster than the full-physics atmospheric transport model on similar hardware. This speedup allows for computation of footprints "on-the-fly'' during the GHG flux inversion (i.e., computed as needed, rather than archiving for future use) and makes near-real-time emission monitoring computationally possible. This work alleviates a major computational bottleneck with inferring GHG fluxes with next generation dense observing systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of U-net++ models, a type of neural network that performs deep learning, to emulate the shortwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM). The goal is to emulate the RRTM accurately in a small fraction of the computing time, creating a U-net++ that could be used as a parameterization in numerical weather prediction (NWP). Target variables are surface downwelling flux, top-of-atmosphere upwelling flux ( FupTOA), net flux, and a profile of radiative-heating rates. We have devised several ways to make the U-net++ models knowledge-guided, recently identified as a key priority in machine learning (ML) applications to the geosciences. We conduct two experiments to find the best U-net++ configurations. In experiment 1, we train on nontropical sites and test on tropical sites, to assess extreme spatial generalization. In experiment 2, we train on sites from all regions and test on different sites from all regions, with the goal of creating the best possible model for use in NWP. The selected model from experiment 1 shows impressive skill on the tropical testing sites, except four notable deficiencies: large bias and error for heating rate in the upper stratosphere, unreliable FupTOA for profiles with single-layer liquid cloud, large heating-rate bias in the midtroposphere for profiles with multilayer liquid cloud, and negative bias at low zenith angles for all flux components and tropospheric heating rates. The selected model from experiment 2 corrects all but the first deficiency, and both models run {\textasciitilde}104 times faster than the RRTM. Our code is available publicly.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology that uses gradient-boosted regression trees (a machine learning technique) and a full-chemistry simulation (i.e., training dataset) from a chemistry–climate model (CCM) to efficiently generate a parameterization of tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) that is a function of chemical, dynamical, and solar irradiance variables. This surrogate model of OH is designed to be integrated into a CCM and allow for computationally efficient simulation of nonlinear feedbacks between OH and tropospheric constituents that have loss by reaction with OH as their primary sinks (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), volatile organic compounds (VOCs)). Such a model framework is advantageous for studies that require multi-decadal simulations of CH4 or multi-year sensitivity simulations to understand the causes of trends and variations of CO and CH4. To allow the user to easily target the training dataset towards a desired application, we are outlining a methodology to generate a parameterization of OH and not presenting an “off-the-shelf” version of a parameterization to be incorporated into a CCM. This provides for the relatively easy creation of a new parameterization in response to, for example, changes in research goals or the underlying CCM chemistry and/or dynamics schemes. We show that a sample parameterization of OH generated from a CCM simulation is able to reproduce OH concentrations with a normalized root-mean-square error of approximately 5 \% and capture the global mean methane lifetime within approximately 1 \%. Our calculated accuracy of the parameterization assumes inputs being within the bounds of the training dataset. Large excursions from these bounds will likely decrease the overall accuracy. However, we show that the sample parameterization predicts large deviations in OH for an El Niño event that was not part of the training dataset and that the spatial distribution and strength of these deviations are consistent with the event. This result gives confidence in the fidelity of a parameterization developed with our methodology to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of OH to perturbations from large variations in the chemical, dynamical, and solar irradiance drivers of OH. In addition, we discuss how two machine learning metrics, Gain feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values, indicate that the behavior of a parameterization of OH generally accords with our understanding of OH chemistry, even though there are no physics- or chemistry-based constraints on the parameterization.},

The dataset currently covers the period 2003–2016 and will be extended in the future by adding 1 year each year. A reanalysis for greenhouse gases is being produced separately. The CAMS reanalysis builds on the experience gained during the production of the earlier Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) reanalysis and CAMS interim reanalysis. Satellite retrievals of total column CO; tropospheric column NO2; aerosol optical depth (AOD); and total column, partial column and profile ozone retrievals were assimilated for the CAMS reanalysis with ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System. The new reanalysis has an increased horizontal resolution of about 80\&thinsp;km and provides more chemical species at a better temporal resolution (3-hourly analysis fields, 3-hourly forecast fields and hourly surface forecast fields) than the previously produced CAMS interim reanalysis. The CAMS reanalysis has smaller biases compared with most of the independent ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and aerosol optical depth observations used for validation in this paper than the previous two reanalyses and is much improved and more consistent in time, especially compared to the MACC reanalysis. The CAMS reanalysis is a dataset that can be used to compute climatologies, study trends, evaluate models, benchmark other reanalyses or serve as boundary conditions for regional models for past periods.},

	abstract = {The massive surge in the amount of observational field data demands richer and more meaningful collab-oration between data scientists and geoscientists. This document was written by members of the Working Group on Case Studies of the NSF-funded RCN on Intelli-gent Systems Research To Support Geosciences (IS-GEO, https:// is-geo.org/ ) to describe our vision to build and enhance such collaboration through the use of specially-designed benchmark datasets. Benchmark datasets serve as summary descriptions of problem areas, providing a simple interface between disciplines without requiring extensive background knowledge. Benchmark data intend to address a number of overarching goals. First, they are concrete, identifiable, and public, which results in a natural coordination of research efforts across multiple disciplines and institutions. Second, they provide multi-fold opportunities for objective comparison of various algorithms in terms of computational costs, accuracy, utility and other measurable standards, to address a particular question in geoscience. Third, as materials for education, the benchmark data cultivate future human capital and interest in geoscience problems and data science methods. Finally, a concerted effort to produce and publish benchmarks has the potential to spur the development of new data science methods, while provid-ing deeper insights into many fundamental problems in modern geosciences. That is, similarly to the critical role the genomic and molecular biology data archives serve in facilitating the field of bioinformatics, we expect that the proposed geosciences data repository will serve as “catalysts” for the new discicpline of geoinformatics. We describe specifications of a high quality geoscience bench-mark dataset and discuss some of our first benchmark efforts. We invite the Climate Informatics community to join us in creating additional benchmarks that aim to address important climate science problems.},

Here, sensitivities from an AI model at 36-hour lead time were compared to those produced by an adjoint of a dynamical model for an extreme weather event, cyclone Xynthia, presenting very similar structures and with the evolved perturbations leading to similar impacts. This demonstrates the ability of the AI model to learn physically-meaningful spatio-temporal links between atmospheric processes. These findings should enable researchers to conduct initial condition studies in minutes, potentially at lead times into the non-linear regime (typically\&amp;thinsp;\&amp;gt;\&amp;thinsp;5 days), with important applications in observing network design and the study of atmospheric dynamics.},

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is one of the major air pollutants risks to human health worldwide. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are an effective metric for acquiring PM2.5 information, featuring broad coverage and high resolution, which compensate for the sparse and uneven distribution of existing monitoring stations. In this study, a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model for estimating ground PM2.5 concentration directly from AOD products across China in 2017, integrating human activities and various natural variables was proposed. The GBDT model performed well in estimating temporal variability and spatial contrasts in daily PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high fitted model (10-fold cross-validation) coefficients of determination of 0.98 (0.81), low root mean square errors of 3.82 (11.57) μg/m3, and mean absolute error of 1.44 (7.45) μg/m3. Seasonal examinations revealed that summer had the cleanest air with the highest estimation accuracies, whereas winter had the most polluted air with the lowest estimation accuracies. The model successfully captured the PM2.5 distribution pattern across China in 2017, showing high levels in southwest Xinjiang, the North China Plain, and the Sichuan Basin, especially in winter. Compared with other models, the GBDT model showed the highest performance in the estimation of PM2.5 with a 3-km resolution. This algorithm can be adopted to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimation with higher spatial resolution, especially in summer. In general, this study provided a potential method of improving the accuracy of satellite-based ground PM2.5 estimation.},

	abstract = {Extracting globally representative trend information from lower tropospheric ozone observations is extremely difficult due to the highly variable distribution and interannual variability of ozone, and the ongoing shift of ozone precursor emissions from high latitudes to low latitudes. Here we report surface ozone trends at 27 globally distributed remote locations (20 in the Northern Hemisphere, 7 in the Southern Hemisphere), focusing on continuous time series that extend from the present back to at least 1995. While these sites are only representative of less than 25\% of the global surface area, this analysis provides a range of regional long-term ozone trends for the evaluation of global chemistry-climate models. Trends are based on monthly mean ozone anomalies, and all sites have at least 20 years of data, which improves the likelihood that a robust trend value is due to changes in ozone precursor emissions and/or forced climate change rather than naturally occurring climate variability. Since 1995, the Northern Hemisphere sites are nearly evenly split between positive and negative ozone trends, while 5 of 7 Southern Hemisphere sites have positive trends. Positive trends are in the range of 0.5–2 ppbv decade–1, with ozone increasing at Mauna Loa by roughly 50\% since the late 1950s. Two high elevation Alpine sites, discussed by previous assessments, exhibit decreasing ozone trends in contrast to the positive trend observed by IAGOS commercial aircraft in the European lower free-troposphere. The Alpine sites frequently sample polluted European boundary layer air, especially in summer, and can only be representative of lower free tropospheric ozone if the data are carefully filtered to avoid boundary layer air. The highly variable ozone trends at these 27 surface sites are not necessarily indicative of free tropospheric trends, which have been overwhelmingly positive since the mid-1990s, as shown by recent studies of ozonesonde and aircraft observations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the vertical resolution for Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) nadir ozone retrievals is established and is used to assess the ability of TES to capture time variations of ozone in the troposphere. This characterization is based on retrievals of ozone using simulated radiances generated from ozonesonde profiles taken over Bermuda from 14 April to 25 May 1993. To that end, a two-step retrieval strategy that includes an initial estimate of the “shape” of the ozone followed by a finer-resolution estimate was developed to provide rapid and robust convergence against large deviations of ozone profiles in the troposphere and lower stratosphere relative to a climatology. An error analysis is derived that accurately accounts for representation errors of the profile, choices of regularization, and the dependence of the retrieval error on both the statistics of the profile and spectral measurement noise, as well as the sensitivity of these retrievals to errors in temperature. This analysis shows that TES should be able to retrieve ozone in the nadir with an approximately 6 km resolution in the troposphere. The root-mean square errors in estimates of the upper and lower tropospheric columns are about 1.35 Dobson units (DU) each. With this vertical resolution, TES would have the sensitivity to detect both the enhanced and reduced tropospheric ozone present in the Bermuda data set. Coupled with a 2-day near-repeat orbit and global coverage, TES retrievals of ozone could provide invaluable information to distinguish between anthropogenic and meteorological sources for the time variability of ozone in the troposphere.},

In order to improve the accuracy of estimating groundlevel O3 concentration, this study adopted a deep forest algorithm to construct a model for estimating near-ground O3 concentration. It is pointed out whether input data on particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations also affect the estimation accuracy. The model first uses the multi-granularity scanning technique to learn the features of the training set, and then it adopts the cascade forest structure to train the processed data, and at the same time, it adaptively adjusts the number of layers in order to achieve a better performance. Daily near-ground O3 concentrations in Shijiazhuang were estimated using satellite O3 column concentrations, ground-based PM2.5 and NO2 concentration data, meteorological element data, and elevation data. The deep forest model was compared with six models, namely, random forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, and GBDT. The R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed deep forest model were 0.9560, 13.2542, and 9.0250, respectively, which had significant advantages over other tree-based regression models. Meanwhile, the model performance was improved by adding NO2 and PM2.5 features to the model estimations, indicating the necessity of synergistic observations of NO2, PM2.5, and O3.

	abstract = {SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) is a spectrometer designed to measure sunlight transmitted, reﬂected, and scattered by the earth’s atmosphere or surface in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelength region (240–2380 nm) at moderate spectral resolution (0.2–1.5 nm, l/Dl ¯ 1000–10 000). SCIAMACHY will measure the earthshine radiance in limb and nadir viewing geometries and solar or lunar light transmitted through the atmosphere observed in occultation. The extraterrestrial solar irradiance and lunar radiance will be determined from observations of the sun and the moon above the atmosphere. The absorption, reﬂection, and scattering behavior of the atmosphere and the earth’s surface is determined from comparison of earthshine radiance and solar irradiance. Inversion of the ratio of earthshine radiance and solar irradiance yields information about the amounts and distribution of important atmospheric constituents and the spectral reﬂectance (or albedo) of the earth’s surface.},

	abstract = {The inverse radiative transfer equation to retrieve atmospheric ozone distribution from the UV-visible satellite spectrometer Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) has been modeled by means of a feed forward neural network. This Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) was trained exclusively on a data set of GOME radiances collocated with ozone measurements from ozonesondes, Halogen Occultation Experiment, Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II, and Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement III. Network input consists of a combination of spectral, geolocation, and climatological information (time and latitude). In the stratosphere the method globally reduces standard deviation with respect to an ozone climatology by around 40\%. Tropospheric ozone can also be retrieved in many cases with corresponding reduction of 10–30\%. All GOME data from January 1996 to July 2001 were processed. In a number of case studies involving comparisons with ozonesondes from Hohenpeissenberg, Syowa, and results from the classical Full Retrieval Method, we found good agreement with our results. The neural network was found capable of implicitly correcting for instrument degradation, pixel cloudiness, and scan angle effects. Integrated profiles generally agree to within ±5\% with the monthly Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer version 7 total ozone field. However, some problems remain at high solar zenith angles and very low ozone values, where local deviations of 10–20\% have been observed in some cases. In order to better characterize individual ozone profiles, two local error estimation methods are presented. Vertical resolution of the profiles was assessed empirically and seems to be of the order of 4–6 km. Since neural network retrieval is a mathematically simple, one-step procedure, NNORSY is about 103–105 times faster than classical retrieval techniques based upon optimal estimation.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm approach called Weighting Function Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFDOAS) is presented which has been developed to retrieve total ozone columns from nadir observations of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment. By fitting the vertically integrated ozone weighting function rather than ozone cross-section to the sun-normalized radiances, a direct retrieval of vertical column amounts is possible. The new WFDOAS approach takes into account the slant path wavelength modulation that is usually neglected in the standard DOAS approach using single airmass factors. This paper focuses on the algorithm description and error analysis, while in a companion paper by Weber et al. (2004) a detailed validation with groundbased measurements is presented. For the first time several auxiliary quantities directly derived from the GOME spectral range such as cloud-top-height and cloud fraction (O2-A band) and effective albedo using the Lambertian Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) near 377nm are used in combination as input to the ozone retrieval. In addition the varying ozone dependent contribution to the Raman correction in scattered light known as Ring effect has been included. The molecular ozone filling-in that is accounted for in the new algorithm has the largest contribution to the improved total ozone results from WFDOAS compared to the operational product. The precision of the total ozone retrieval is estimated to be better than 3\% for solar zenith angles below 80\&deg;.},

	abstract = {The Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument (GOME-2) was launched on EUMESAT's MetOp-A satellite in October 2006. This paper is concerned with the retrieval algorithm GOME Data Processor (GDP) version 4.4 used by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Ozone and Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring (O3M-SAF) for the operational generation of GOME-2 total ozone products. GDP 4.4 is the latest version of the GDP 4.0 algorithm, which is employed for the generation of official Level 2 total ozone and other trace gas products from GOME and SCIAMACHY. Here we focus on enhancements introduced in GDP 4.4: improved cloud retrieval algorithms including detection of Sun glint effects, a correction for intracloud ozone, better treatment of snow and ice conditions, accurate radiative transfer modeling for large viewing angles, and elimination of scan angle dependencies inherited from Level 1 radiances. Furthermore, the first global validation results for 3 years (2007–2009) of GOME-2/MetOp-A total ozone measurements using Brewer and Dobson measurements as references are presented. The GOME-2/MetOp-A total ozone data obtained with GDP 4.4 slightly underestimates ground-based ozone by about 0.5\% to 1\% over the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and slightly overestimates by around 0.5\% over the middle latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Over high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, GOME-2 total ozone has almost no offset relative to Dobson readings, while over high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere GOME-2 exhibits a small negative bias below 1\%. For tropical latitudes, GOME-2 measures on average lower ozone by 0\% to 2\% compared to Dobson measurements.},

On average, IASI ozone retrievals exhibit a positive bias of about 9 DU (3.3\%) compared to both GOME-2 and ground-based measurements. In addition to total ozone columns, the good spectral resolution of IASI enables the retrieval of tropospheric ozone concentrations. Comparisons of IASI tropospheric columns to 490 collocated ozone soundings available from several stations around the globe have been performed for the period of June 2007–August 2008. IASI tropospheric ozone columns compare well with sonde observations, with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.77 for the [surface–6 km] and [surface–12 km] partial columns, respectively. IASI retrievals tend to overestimate the tropospheric ozone columns in comparison with ozonesonde measurements.

Approximately 1600 coincidences spanning 72.5°S–80.3°N from October 2004 to October 2006 are found. The TES averaging kernel and constraint are applied to the ozonesonde data to account for the TES measurement sensitivity and vertical resolution. TES sonde differences are examined in six latitude zones after excluding profiles with thick high clouds. Values for the bias and standard deviation are determined using correlations of mean values of TES ozone and sonde ozone in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower troposphere (LT). The UT biases range from 2.9 to 10.6 ppbv, and the LT biases range from 3.7 to 9.2 ppbv, excluding the Arctic and Antarctic LT where TES sensitivity is low. A similar approach is used to assess seasonal differences in the northern midlatitudes where the density and frequency of sonde measurements are greatest. These results are briefly compared to TES V001 ozone validation work which also used ozonesondes but was carried out prior to improvements in the radiometric calibration and ozone retrieval in V002. Overall, the large number of TES and sonde comparisons indicate a positive bias of approximately 3–10 ppbv for the TES V002 nadir ozone data set and have helped to identify areas of potential improvement for future retrieval versions.},

	abstract = {We characterise a transboundary ozone pollution outbreak transported across East Asia in early May 2009 using new multispectral satellite observations of lowermost tropospheric ozone (located below 3 km altitude) in synergy with other satellite data and models. Our analysis is focused on the daily evolution of ozone pollution plumes initially formed over the North China Plain (NCP) and their transport pathways over northern China, Korea, Japan and the surrounding seas. A main aspect of the study is an estimation of the contribution of photochemical production of ozone during transport using the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements with respect to background levels derived from satellite data and also from chemistry–transport models.

A key contribution of the analysis is the use of new satellite data offering unprecedented skills to observe the horizontal distribution of lowermost tropospheric ozone over East Asia on a daily basis, with a multispectral approach called IASI + GOME2 (combining Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer observations in the IR and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 measurements in the UV). These satellite observations are in good agreement with ozonesondes, with low mean biases (3 \%), a precision of about 16 \%, a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and practically the same standard deviation for a comparison based on 2 years of data from 46 launching stations distributed worldwide, during all seasons. A similar agreement is also found over East Asia. Moreover, IASI + GOME2 offers a unique capacity for observing the evolution of near-surface ozone during pollution outbreaks (with 5 \% bias and 0.69 correlation), according to a comparison with surface in situ measurements during two major ozone events over several Japanese islands. Single-band ozone retrievals, such as those from IASI in the thermal infrared, do not capture such variability.

Using IASI + GOME2, we show that (i) ozone pollution plumes are transported by an anticyclonic circulation around the Yellow Sea from the NCP to northern China, Korea and Japan, collocated with carbon monoxide plumes; (ii) over northern China the plume splits into two pollution filaments with one mixing with freshly emitted pollutants; and (iii) ozone is produced every day of the event, accounting for an enhancement in concentration during transport across East Asia of up to ∼ 84 \% with respect to that produced over NCP. This estimation is done according to monotonically increasing values during 7 days of the ratio of ozone to carbon monoxide enhancements within the transported pollution plumes from about ∼ 0.25 over the NCP to ∼ 0.46 over the Pacific south of Japan.},

	abstract = {Potential sources of a priori ozone (O3) profiles for use in Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) satellite tropospheric O3 retrievals are evaluated with observations from multiple Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) systems in North America. An O3 profile climatology (tropopause-based O3 climatology (TB-Clim), currently proposed for use in the TEMPO O3 retrieval algorithm) derived from ozonesonde observations and O3 profiles from three separate models (operational Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) product, reanalysis product from Modern-era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2), and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM)) were: (1) evaluated with TOLNet measurements on various temporal scales (seasonally, daily, and hourly) and (2) implemented as a priori information in theoretical TEMPO tropospheric O3 retrievals in order to determine how each a priori impacts the accuracy of retrieved tropospheric (0–10\&thinsp;km) and lowermost tropospheric (LMT, 0–2\&thinsp;km) O3 columns. We found that all sources of a priori O3 profiles evaluated in this study generally reproduced the vertical structure of summer-averaged observations. However, larger differences between the a priori profiles and lidar observations were calculated when evaluating inter-daily and diurnal variability of tropospheric O3. The TB-Clim O3 profile climatology was unable to replicate observed inter-daily and diurnal variability of O3 while model products, in particular GEOS-Chem simulations, displayed more skill in reproducing these features. Due to the ability of models, primarily the CTM used in this study, on average to capture the inter-daily and diurnal variability of tropospheric and LMT O3 columns, using a priori profiles from CTM simulations resulted in TEMPO retrievals with the best statistical comparison with lidar observations. Furthermore, important from an air quality perspective, when high LMT O3 values were observed, using CTM a priori profiles resulted in TEMPO LMT O3 retrievals with the least bias. The application of near-real-time (non-climatological) hourly and daily model predictions as the a priori profile in TEMPO O3 retrievals will be best suited when applying this data to study air quality or event-based processes as the standard retrieval algorithm will still need to use a climatology product. Follow-on studies to this work are currently being conducted to investigate the application of different CTM-predicted O3 climatology products in the standard TEMPO retrieval algorithm. Finally, similar methods to those used in this study can be easily applied by TEMPO data users to recalculate tropospheric O3 profiles provided from the standard retrieval using a different source of a priori.},

	abstract = {In October 2017, the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission was launched, carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which provides a daily global coverage at a spatial resolution as high as 7\&thinsp;km\&thinsp;×\&thinsp;3.5\&thinsp;km and is expected to extend the European atmospheric composition record initiated with GOME/ERS-2 in 1995, enhancing our scientific knowledge of atmospheric processes with its unprecedented spatial resolution. Due to the ongoing need to understand and monitor the recovery of the ozone layer, as well as the evolution of tropospheric pollution, total ozone remains one of the leading species of interest during this mission.

 In this work, the TROPOMI near real time (NRTI) and offline (OFFL) total ozone column (TOC) products are presented and compared to daily ground-based quality-assured Brewer and Dobson TOC measurements deposited in the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC). Additional comparisons to individual Brewer measurements from the Canadian Brewer Network and the European Brewer Network (Eubrewnet) are performed. Furthermore, twilight zenith-sky measurements obtained with ZSL-DOAS (Zenith Scattered Light Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) instruments, which form part of the SAOZ network (Système d'Analyse par Observation Zénitale), are used for the validation. The quality of the TROPOMI TOC data is evaluated in terms of the influence of location, solar zenith angle, viewing angle, season, effective temperature, surface albedo and clouds. For this purpose, globally distributed ground-based measurements have been utilized as the background truth. The overall statistical analysis of the global comparison shows that the mean bias and the mean standard deviation of the percentage difference between TROPOMI and ground-based TOC is within 0\&thinsp;–1.5\&thinsp;\% and 2.5\&thinsp;\%–4.5\&thinsp;\%, respectively. The mean bias that results from the comparisons is well within the S5P product requirements, while the mean standard deviation is very close to those limits, especially considering that the statistics shown here originate both from the satellite and the ground-based measurements.

 Additionally, the TROPOMI OFFL and NRTI products are evaluated against already known spaceborne sensors, namely, the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite, on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (OMPS/Suomi-NPP), NASA v2 TOCs, and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2), on board the Metop-A (GOME-2/Metop-A) and Metop-B (GOME-2/Metop-B) satellites. This analysis shows a very good agreement for both TROPOMI products with well-established instruments, with the absolute differences in mean bias and mean standard deviation being below +0.7\&thinsp;\% and 1\&thinsp;\%, respectively. These results assure the scientific community of the good quality of the TROPOMI TOC products during its first year of operation and enhance the already prevalent expectation that TROPOMI/S5P will play a very significant role in the continuity of ozone monitoring from space.},

The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the estimation of surface NO2 concentrations over Germany using a machine learning approach. TROPOMI satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and several meteorological parameters are used to train the neural network model for the prediction of surface NO2 concentrations. The neural network model is validated against ground-based in situ air quality monitoring network measurements and regional chemical transport model (CTM) simulations. Neural network estimation of surface NO2 concentrations show good agreement with in situ monitor data with Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.80. The results also show that the machine learning approach is performing better than regional CTM simulations in predicting surface NO2 concentrations. We also performed a sensitivity analysis for each input parameter of the neural network model. The validated neural network model is then used to estimate surface NO2 concentrations over Germany from 2018 to 2020. Estimated surface NO2 concentrations are used to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics, such as seasonal and weekly variations of NO2 in Germany. The estimated surface NO2 concentrations provide comprehensive information of NO2 spatial distribution which is very useful for exposure estimation. We estimated the annual average NO2 exposure for 2018, 2019 and 2020 is 15.53, 15.24 and 13.27 µµg/m3, respectively. While the annual average NO2 concentration of 2018, 2019 and 2020 is only 12.79, 12.60 and 11.15 µµg/m3. In addition, we used the surface NO2 data set to investigate the impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on ambient NO2 levels in Germany. In general, 10–30\% lower surface NO2 concentrations are observed in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019, indicating the significant impacts of a series of restriction measures to reduce the spread of the virus.},

	abstract = {Past studies have suggested that ozone in the troposphere has increased globally throughout much of the 20th century due to increases in anthropogenic emissions and transport. We show, by combining satellite measurements with a chemical transport model, that during the last four decades tropospheric ozone does indeed indicate increases that are global in nature, yet still highly regional. Satellite ozone measurements from Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) are merged with ozone measurements from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) to determine trends in tropospheric ozone for 1979–2016. Both TOMS (1979–2005) and OMI/MLS (2005–2016) depict large increases in tropospheric ozone from the Near East to India and East Asia and further eastward over the Pacific Ocean. The 38-year merged satellite record shows total net change over this region of about +6 to +7 Dobson units (DU) (i.e., ∼15\&thinsp;\%–20\&thinsp;\% of average background ozone), with the largest increase (∼4\&thinsp;DU) occurring during the 2005–2016 Aura period. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model with time-varying emissions is used to aid in the interpretation of tropospheric ozone trends for 1980–2016. The GMI simulation for the combined record also depicts the greatest increases of +6 to +7\&thinsp;DU over India and East Asia, very similar to the satellite measurements. In regions of significant increases in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) the trends are a factor of 2–2.5 larger for the Aura record when compared to the earlier TOMS record; for India and East Asia the trends in TCO for both GMI and satellite measurements are ∼+3\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 or greater during 2005–2016 compared to about +1.2 to +1.4\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 for 1979–2005. The GMI simulation and satellite data also reveal a tropospheric ozone increases in ∼+4 to +5\&thinsp;DU for the 38-year record over central Africa and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Both the GMI simulation and satellite-measured tropospheric ozone during the latter Aura time period show increases of ∼+3\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 over the N Atlantic and NE Pacific.},

This study aims to develop models for estimating high spatial resolution surface concentrations of NO2 and O3 from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data in East Asia. The machine learning was adopted by fusion of various satellite-based variables, numerical model-based meteorological variables, and land-use variables. Four machine learning approaches—Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)—were evaluated and compared with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as a base statistical method. This study also modeled the NO2 and O3 concentrations over the ocean surface (i.e., land model for scheme 1 and ocean model for scheme 2). The estimated surface concentrations were validated through three cross-validation approaches (i.e., random, temporal, and spatial). The results showed that the NO2 model produced R2 of 0.63–0.70 and normalized root-mean-square-error (nRMSE) of 38.3–42.2\% and the O3 model resulted in R2 of 0.65–0.78 and nRMSE of 19.6–24.7\% for scheme 1. The indirect validation based on the stations near the coastline for scheme 2 showed slight decrease ({\textasciitilde}0.3–2.4\%) in nRMSE when compared to scheme 1. The contributions of input variables to the models were analyzed based on SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The NO2 vertical column density among the TROPOMI-derived variables showed the largest contribution in both the NO2 and O3 models.},

Here we propose a new method to infer spatial variability in surface ozone by combining multispectral ozone retrievals using radiances from the tropospheric emission spectrometer thermal infrared instrument and the ozone monitoring instrument ultratraviolet/visible instrument with a chemical reanalysis. We find that our inferred surface ozone in summertime China and the United States has regional biases of less than 4 ppb and a high spatial correlation when validated against independent surface measurements. Over the broader Asia region, our analysis results in a spatial pattern of summertime surface ozone that can largely be explained by a combination of the Asian monsoon circulation and emissions. Our results show the potential of combining satellite measurements and chemical reanalyses to provide critical air quality information in regions of limited surface networks, thereby enhancing the global air quality observing system.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant with negative health effects and a precursor of ozone and particulate matter responsible for photo-chemical smog and wintertime air pollution. To evaluate human exposure to NO2 for public health assessment, maps of near-surface NO2 concentrations at a high resolution of 100 m are desirable. In this study, we report hourly maps of gridded near-surface NO2 concentrations that are produced using an extreme gradient-boosted tree ensemble for an Alpine domain (Switzerland and northern Italy) spanning two years, from June 2018 to May 2020. To estimate the NO2 distribution at ground level, we used satellite observations of NO2 vertical column density, land use data, meteorological fields and topographical information to train models with in situ NO2 ground measurements. The best model with this approach captured up to 59\% of hourly NO2 variation for 40 test stations in the domain with a mean absolute error of 7.69μg/m3, performing especially well for urban regions with dense sampling. We present the first hourly maps of NO2 concentrations that reveal previously unresolved spatio-temporal variations. Local interpretations of the machine learning model demonstrate that TROPOMI NO2 satellite observations make a strong contribution to the information content of the near-surface NO2 maps besides their relatively coarse resolution (3.5 × 5.5 km2) and the fact that they are only available once a day under cloud-free conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown presents a case study that offers new insights into the importance of satellite data that can partially re-mediate statistical models' unsusceptibility to unusual events (like changes due to political intervention) with regard to model training.},

To obtain spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 distributions, various gap-filling methods have been developed, but have rarely been evaluated. Here, we reviewed and summarized four types of gap-filling strategies, and applied them to a random forest PM2.5 prediction model that incorporated ground observations, chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, and satellite AOD for predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km resolution in 2013 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta. The model out-of-bag predictions were compared with national station measurements and external measurements to assess the performance of different gap-filling methods. We also conducted a by-city cross-validation and characterized the spatial distributions of PM2.5 prediction when the AOD coverage was low. We found that the methods filling in missing data by regression, i.e. multiple imputation and decision tree, performed robustly to characterizing PM2.5 variation at a high spatial resolution and the method filling in missing PM2.5 predictions with decision tree overcame the problem of time-consuming computations. The method using spatiotemporal trends to fill in missing data, i.e. ordinary kriging and generalized additive mixed model, may be overrated in statistical evaluation tests, and predicted artificially oversmoothed PM2.5 spatial distributions. We also revealed that CTM simulations benefited the prediction of PM2.5 spatial distribution in all the models with various gap-filling strategies with higher prediction accuracy in the by-city cross-validation. We noticed that the PM2.5 prediction was not sensitive to the resolution of CTM simulations and even the 12-km resolution CTM simulations benefited the high-resolution PM2.5 prediction.},

	abstract = {Isoprene is the dominant nonmethane organic compound emitted to the atmosphere, where it drives ozone and aerosol production, modulates atmospheric oxidation, and interacts with the global nitrogen cycle. Isoprene emissions are highly variable and uncertain, as is the nonlinear chemistry coupling isoprene and its primary sink, the hydroxyl radical. Space-based isoprene measurements can help close the gap on these uncertainties, and when combined with concurrent formaldehyde data provide a new constraint on atmospheric oxidation regimes. Here, we present a next-generation machine-learning isoprene retrieval for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) that provides improved sensitivity, lower noise, and thus higher space-time resolution than earlier approaches. The Retrieval of Organics from CrIS Radiances (ROCR) isoprene measurements compare well with previous space-based retrievals as well as with the first-ever ground-based isoprene column measurements, with 20\%–50\% discrepancies that reflect differing sources of systematic uncertainty. An ensemble of sensitivity tests points to the spectral background and isoprene profile specification as the most relevant uncertainty sources in the ROCR framework. We apply the ROCR isoprene algorithm to the full CrIS record from 2012 to 2020, showing that it can resolve fine-scale spatial gradients at daily resolution over the world's isoprene hotspots. Results over North America and Amazonia highlight emergent connections between isoprene abundance and daily-to-interannual variations in temperature and nitrogen oxides.},

	abstract = {Despite recent progress, satellite retrievals of anthropogenic SO2 still suffer from relatively low signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we demonstrate a new machine learning data analysis method to improve the quality of satellite SO2 products. In the absence of large ground-truth datasets for SO2, we start from SO2 slant column densities (SCDs) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) using a data-driven, physically based algorithm and calculate the ratio between the SCD and the root mean square (rms) of the fitting residuals for each pixel. To build the training data, we select presumably clean pixels with small SCD / rms ratios (SRRs) and set their target SCDs to zero. For polluted pixels with relatively large SRRs, we set the target to the original retrieved SCDs. We then train neural networks (NNs) to reproduce the target SCDs using predictors including SRRs for individual pixels, solar zenith, viewing zenith and phase angles, scene reflectivity, and O3 column amounts, as well as the monthly mean SRRs. For data analysis, we employ two NNs: (1) one trained daily to produce analyzed SO2 SCDs for polluted pixels each day and (2) the other trained once every month to produce analyzed SCDs for less polluted pixels for the entire month. Test results for 2005 show that our method can significantly reduce noise and artifacts over background regions. Over polluted areas, the monthly mean NN-analyzed and original SCDs generally agree to within ±15 \%, indicating that our method can retain SO2 signals in the original retrievals except for large volcanic eruptions. This is further confirmed by running both the NN-analyzed and original SCDs through a top-down emission algorithm to estimate the annual SO2 emissions for ∼500 anthropogenic sources, with the two datasets yielding similar results. We also explore two alternative approaches to the NN-based analysis method. In one, we employ a simple linear interpolation model to analyze the original SCD retrievals. In the other, we develop a PCA–NN algorithm that uses OMI measured radiances, transformed and dimension-reduced with a principal component analysis (PCA) technique, as inputs to NNs for SO2 SCD retrievals. While the linear model and the PCA–NN algorithm can reduce retrieval noise, they both underestimate SO2 over polluted areas. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that our new data analysis method can significantly improve the quality of existing OMI SO2 retrievals. The method can potentially be adapted for other sensors and/or species and enhance the value of satellite data in air quality research and applications.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance in controlling the abundance of methane (CH4) and a myriad of other tropospheric species, the hydroxyl radical (OH) is poorly constrained due to its large spatial heterogeneity and the inability to measure tropospheric OH with satellites. Here, we present a methodology to infer tropospheric column OH (TCOH) in the tropics over the open oceans using a combination of a machine learning model, output from a simulation of the GEOS model, and satellite observations. Our overall goals are to assess the feasibility of our methodology, to identify potential limitations, and to suggest areas of improvement in the current observational network. The methodology reproduces the variability of TCOH from independent 3D model output and of observations from the Atmospheric Tomography mission (ATom). While the methodology also reproduces the magnitude of the 3D model validation set, the accuracy of the magnitude when applied to observations is uncertain because current observations are insufficient to fully evaluate the machine learning model. Despite large uncertainties in some of the satellite retrievals necessary to infer OH, particularly for NO2 and formaldehyde (HCHO), current satellite observations are of sufficient quality to apply the machine learning methodology, resulting in an error comparable to that of in situ OH observations. Finally, the methodology is not limited to a specific suite of satellite retrievals. Comparison of TCOH determined from two sets of retrievals does show, however, that systematic biases in NO2, resulting both from retrieval algorithm and instrumental differences, lead to relative biases in the calculated TCOH. Further evaluation of NO2 retrievals in the remote atmosphere is needed to determine their accuracy. With slight modifications, a similar methodology could likely be expanded to the extratropics and over land, with the benefits of increasing our understanding of the atmospheric oxidation capacity and, for instance, informing understanding of recent CH4 trends.},

The abundance of OH in cities initiates the removal of local pollutants; therefore, it serves as the key species describing the urban chemical environment. We propose a machine learning (ML) approach as an efficient alternative to OH simulation using a computationally expensive chemical transport model. The ML model is trained on the parameters simulated from the WRF-Chem model, and it suggests that six predictive parameters are capable of explaining 76\% of the OH variability. The parameters are the tropospheric NO2 column, the tropospheric HCHO column, J(O1D), H2O, temperature, and pressure. We then use observations of the tropospheric NO2 column and HCHO column from OMI as input to the ML model to enable measurement-based prediction of daily near surface OH at 1:30 pm local time across 49 North American cities over the course of 10 years between 2005 and 2014. The result is validated by comparing the OH predictions to measurements of isoprene, which has a source that is uncorrelated with OH and is removed rapidly and almost exclusively by OH in the daytime. We demonstrate that the predicted OH is, as expected, anticorrelated with isoprene. We also show that this ML model is consistent with our understanding of OH chemistry given the solely data-driven nature.},

	abstract = {The continued interest in air pollution and stratospheric ozone variability has motivated the development of a Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) for hourly ozone monitoring. This paper provides the atmospheric science community with the world's first assessment of GEMS total column ozone (TCO) retrieval performance and diurnal ozone variation. The algorithm used for GEMS is a more advanced version of its predecessor, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) V8, that incorporates several improvements, including a new lookup table, a simple Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity model, and a spectral dependence correction. The GEMS algorithm also uses the optimal estimation method (OEM) to make error analysis more accessible and robust. The estimated retrieval errors range from 1.5 to 2 DU in September and 2 DU in December, with a constant degree of freedom of the signal (DFS) of 1 in September and a variable DFS of 1.25 to 1.4 in December throughout the day, depending on solar zenith angle (SZA). To assess the performance of the GEMS algorithm, the hourly GEMS total ozone was compared with ground-based measurements from Pandora instruments and other satellite platforms from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) and OMPS (Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Nadir Mapper). GEMS has a high correlation of 0.97 and small RMSE values compared to Pandora TCO at Busan and Seoul in South Korea. It is notable that despite exhibiting seasonal dependence in the mean bias of GEMS with Pandora, GEMS is capable of observing daily variations in ozone that are highly consistent with Pandora measurements, with a bias of approximately 1 \%. The comparison of GEMS TCO data with TROPOMI and OMPS TCO data shows a high correlation of 0.99 and low RMSE compared to TROPOMI and OMPS TCO data, but the data have a negative bias of −2.38 \% and −2.17 \%, with standard deviations of 1.33 \% and 1.57 \%, respectively. Similar to OMPS, the influence of SO2 from volcanic eruptions is not properly removed in some regions, leading to GEMS overestimating TCO in those areas. The mean biases of GEMS TCO data with TROPOMI and OMPS TCO are within ±1 \% at low latitudes but become negative at midlatitudes, with an increasingly negative dependence on latitude. Furthermore, this dependence becomes more prominent from summer to winter. The empirical correction applied to the GEMS irradiance data improves the dependence of the mean bias on season and latitude, but a consistent bias still remains, and a marginal positive trend was observed in December. Therefore, further investigation into correction methods is needed. The results are a meaningful scientific advance by providing the first validated, hourly UV ozone retrievals from a satellite in geostationary orbit. This experience can be used to advance research with future geostationary environmental satellite missions, including the incoming TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) and Sentinel-4.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions of methane (CH4) have made a considerable contribution towards the Earth's changing radiative budget since pre-industrial times. This is because large amounts of methane are emitted from human activities, and the global warming potential of methane is high. The majority of anthropogenic fossil methane emissions to the atmosphere originate from a large number of small (point) sources. Thus, detection and accurate, rapid quantification of such emissions are vital to enable the reduction of emissions to help mitigate future climate change. There exist a number of instruments on satellites that measure radiation at methane-absorbing wavelengths, which have sufficiently high spatial resolution that can be used for detecting plumes of highly spatially localised methane “point sources” (areas on the order of m2 to km2). Searching for methane plumes in methane-sensitive satellite images using classical methods, such as thresholding and clustering, can be useful but is time-consuming and often involves empirical decisions. Here, we develop a deep neural network to identify and quantify methane point source emissions from hyperspectral imagery from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite with 30 m spatial resolution. The moderately high spectral and spatial resolution, as well as considerable global coverage and free access to data, makes PRISMA a good candidate for methane plume detection. The neural network was trained with simulated synthetic methane plumes generated with the large eddy simulation extension of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-LES), which we embedded into PRISMA images. The deep neural network was successful at locating plumes with a F1 score, precision, and recall of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.92, respectively, and was able to quantify emission rates with a mean error of 24 \%. The neural network was furthermore able to locate several plumes in real-world images. We have thus demonstrated that our method can be effective in locating and quantifying methane point source emissions in near-real time from 30 m resolution satellite data, which can aid us in mitigating future climate change.},

	abstract = {Satellite observations of dry-column methane mixing ratios (XCH4) from shortwave infrared (SWIR) solar backscatter radiation provide a powerful resource to quantify methane emissions in service of climate action. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), launched in October 2017, provides global daily coverage at a 5.5 × 7 km2 (nadir) pixel resolution, but its methane retrievals can suffer from biases associated with SWIR surface albedo, scattering from aerosols and cirrus clouds, and across-track variability (striping). The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) instrument, launched in 2009, has better spectral characteristics and its methane retrieval is much less subject to biases, but its data density is 250 times sparser than TROPOMI. Here, we present a blended TROPOMI+GOSAT methane product obtained by training a machine learning (ML) model to predict the difference between TROPOMI and GOSAT co-located measurements, using only predictor variables included in the TROPOMI retrieval, and then applying the correction to the complete TROPOMI record from April 2018 to present. We find that the largest corrections are associated with coarse aerosol particles, high SWIR surface albedo, and across-track pixel index. Our blended product corrects a systematic difference between TROPOMI and GOSAT over water, and it features corrections exceeding 10 ppb over arid land, persistently cloudy regions, and high northern latitudes. It reduces the TROPOMI spatially variable bias over land (referenced to GOSAT data) from 14.3 to 10.4 ppb at a 0.25∘ × 0.3125∘ resolution. Validation with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based column measurements shows reductions in variable bias compared with the original TROPOMI data from 4.7 to 4.4 ppb and in single-retrieval precision from 14.5 to 11.9 ppb. TCCON data are all in locations with a SWIR surface albedo below 0.4 (where TROPOMI biases tend to be relatively low), but they confirm the dependence of TROPOMI biases on SWIR surface albedo and coarse aerosol particles, as well as the reduction of these biases in the blended product. Fine-scale inspection of the Arabian Peninsula shows that a number of hotspots in the original TROPOMI data are removed as artifacts in the blended product. The blended product also corrects striping and aerosol/cloud biases in single-orbit TROPOMI data, enabling better detection and quantification of ultra-emitters. Residual coastal biases can be removed by applying additional filters. The ML method presented here can be applied more generally to validate and correct data from any new satellite instrument by reference to a more established instrument.},

Using the first-of-its-kind capabilities of GEMS NO2 data, we examined how well GEMS NO2 levels can explain the spatiotemporal variabilities in hourly NO2 concentrations in the Republic of Korea for the year 2022. A correlation analysis between hourly GEMS NO2 levels and ground NO2 concentrations showed a higher spatial correlation [Pearson r = 0.56 (SD = 0.20)] than a temporal one [Pearson r = 0.42 (SD = 0.14)], on average. To take advantage of the enhanced spatial predictability of GEMS NO2 data, we employed a mixed effects model to allow hour-specific relationships between GEMS NO2 and NO2 concentrations on a given day in each region and subsequently estimated hourly NO2 concentrations in all urban and rural areas. The 10-fold cross validation demonstrated R2 = 0.72, mean absolute error (MAE) = 3.7 ppb, and root mean squared error (RMSE) = 5.5 ppb. The hourly variations of the relationships were attributed particularly to those of wind speed among meteorological parameters considered in this study. The spatial distributions of hourly estimated NO2 concentrations were highly correlated between hours [average r = 0.91 (SD = 0.06)]. Nonetheless, they represented the diurnal patterns of urban versus rural NO2 contrasts during the day [urban/rural NO2 ratios from 1.22 (5 p.m.) to 1.37 (12 p.m.)]. The newly retrieved GEMS NO2 data enable temporally as well as spatially resolved NO2 exposure assessment. In combination with the time-activity patterns of individual subjects, the GEMS NO2 data can generate ‘sub-population’ exposure estimates and therefore enhance health effect studies.},

Because of limitations in our ability to observe OH, we have historically relied on indirect methods to constrain its concentrations, trends, and variations, but only as annual global or semi-hemispheric averages. Recent methods demonstrated the feasibility of indirectly constraining tropospheric OH on finer spatio-temporal scales (e.g., seasonal, 1\&deg; latitude x 1\&deg; longitude), using satellite observations as proxies of the photochemical drivers of OH (e.g., nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, isoprene, water vapor, ozone). We found that there are currently reasonable satellite proxies to constrain about 75 \% of the global source of tropospheric OH and about 50 \% of the global sink. With additional research and investment in observing various volatile organic compounds, there is the potential to constrain an additional 10 \% of the global source and 30 \% of the global sink. In addition, these novel methods could be refined and made more robust by improvements in the capabilities of satellite instruments (e.g., signal-to-noise, spatial resolution) and retrieval algorithms that are used to develop data products. Another benefit of more robust data products is that they may be used to better constrain the chemical and dynamical processes in atmospheric chemical transport models that simulate the spatio-temporal variations of OH and OH drivers. Therefore, we propose steps forward for the development of a strategic and comprehensive space-based and suborbital observing strategy, which will improve our ability to indirectly constrain OH on much finer spatio-temporal scales than previously achieved. We discuss the strengths and limitations of such an observing strategy and potential improvements to current satellite instrument observing capabilities that would enable better constraint of OH. These improvements include ones that are obtainable with current technologies (e.g., more observations, co-located observations) as well as ones requiring additional technology development (e.g., to obtain vertically-resolved observations). Suborbital observations, which are required for information difficult to obtain from space and for validation of satellite-based OH estimates, will be an integral part of a comprehensive observing strategy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These data provide unique information to improve understanding of the sources, chemistry, and transport of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with implications for atmospheric chemistry and air quality, but opportunities for direct validation are very limited. Here we correct the operational level-2 (L2) NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from GEMS with a machine learning (ML) model to match the much sparser but more mature observations from the low Earth orbit TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), preserving the data density of GEMS but making them consistent with TROPOMI. We first reprocess the GEMS and TROPOMI operational L2 products to use common prior vertical NO2 profiles (shape factors) from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. This removes a major inconsistency between the two satellite products and greatly improves their agreement with ground-based Pandora NO2 VCD data in source regions. We then apply the ML model to correct the remaining differences, Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI), using the GEMS NO2 VCDs and retrieval parameters as predictor variables. We train the ML model with colocated GEMS and TROPOMI NO2 VCDs, taking advantage of TROPOMI off-track viewing to cover the wide range of effective zenith angles (EZAs) observed by GEMS. The two most important predictor variables for Δ(GEMS–TROPOMI) are GEMS NO2 VCD and EZA. The corrected GEMS product is unbiased relative to TROPOMI and shows a diurnal variation over source regions more consistent with Pandora than the operational product.},

	abstract = {The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, particularly CO2, has significant implications for global climate patterns and various aspects of human life. Spaceborne remote sensing satellites play a crucial role in high-resolution monitoring of atmospheric CO2. However, the next generation of greenhouse gas monitoring satellites is expected to face challenges, particularly in terms of computational efficiency in atmospheric CO2 retrieval and analysis. To address these challenges, this study focuses on improving the speed of retrieving the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) using spectral data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite while still maintaining retrieval accuracy. A novel approach based on neural network (NN) models is proposed to tackle the nonlinear inversion problems associated with XCO2 retrievals. The study employs a data-driven supervised learning method and explores two distinct training strategies. Firstly, training is conducted using experimental data obtained from the inversion of the operational optimization model, which is released as the OCO-2 satellite products. Secondly, training is performed using a simulated dataset generated by an accurate forward calculation model. The inversion performance and prediction performance of the machine learning model for XCO2 are compared, analyzed, and discussed for the observed region over east Asia. The results demonstrate that the model trained on simulated data accurately predicts XCO2 in the target area. Furthermore, when compared to OCO-2 satellite product data, the developed XCO2 retrieval model not only achieves rapid predictions (\&lt;1 ms) with good accuracy (1.8 ppm or approximately 0.45 \%) but also effectively captures sudden increases in XCO2 plumes near industrial emission sources. The accuracy of the machine learning model retrieval results is validated against reliable data from Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites, demonstrating its ability to effectively capture CO2 seasonal variations and annual growth trends.},

We present here a new version of the Kinetic Pre-Processor (KPP 3.0.0) for fast integration of chemical kinetics featuring a range of improvements over previous versions in performance, diagnostics, versatility, and community openness. KPP 3.0.0 includes a new adaptive auto-reduction solver to decrease the size of any mechanism locally and on the fly under conditions where full complexity is not needed, by partitioning species as “fast” or “slow” based on their local production and loss rates. Previous implementations of this adaptive solver suffered from excessive overhead in the repeated construction of the local Jacobian matrix or were hard-wired to specific mechanisms. Here we retain the general applicability of the method to any mechanism and avoid overhead by using pre-computed Jacobian matrix terms for the full mechanism and cropping the matrix locally to remove the slow species with no change in memory allocation. We apply this adaptive solver within KPP 3.0.0 to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry and demonstrate a 32\% reduction in solver time while maintaining a mean error lower than 1\% for key species in the troposphere.},

	abstract = {Compared with the limited capability of ground-level monitoring, remote sensing provides useful image data at a moderate or high spatial or temporal resolution with global coverage for monitoring of air pollutants, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the MODIS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns for ground-level NO2 concentration. However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59\% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1 × 1 km2) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42 × 1015 molecules/cm2) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80 μg/m3). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a criteria air pollutants posing risks to organisms, and is expected to enhance formation due to climate change. Satellite-based measurements provide a promising approach to estimate ground-level air pollution on large scale. However, most applications of satellite-based measurements have been used for fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, while only a few have been used for O3. In this study, we incorporated satellite-based measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with meteorological variables and land-use data to estimate daily maximum 8-h average O3 at 1-km resolution in Taiwan during 2004–2020. The random forest model was used to impute the missing values of the satellite-based measurements. Additionally, the XGBoost model was leveraged to estimate daily O3 concentrations. Model performance was evaluated by the ten-fold cross-validation (CV), temporal and spatial validation, and the results were reported as the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Our results showed that the 10-fold CV, temporal validated, and spatial validated R2 (RMSE) of the XGBoost model were 0.82 (7.71 ppb), 0.63 (11.09 ppb), and 0.68 (10.27 ppb), respectively. Our model performance was better in central and southern Taiwan. The top ten important predictors were date (relative importance = 12.15\%), temperature (10.77\%), meridional wind (10.71\%), relative humidity (9.60\%), zonal wind (8.14\%), UV radiation (8.07\%), total precipitation (6.35\%), surface pressure (5.34\%), surface O3 volume mixing ratio (4.93\%), and boundary layer height (4.69\%). The spatial distribution of O3 estimates showed that daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentrations were higher in the suburban and mountainous areas near the central and southern Taiwan. This reveals that sensitive populations should still pay attention to the secondary pollutants even when outside the urban areas. The O3 estimates can be further leveraged to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of O3 on human health.},

	abstract = {Ground-level ozone is an important atmospheric oxidant, which exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variability in its concentration level. Existing modeling approaches for ground-level ozone include chemical transport models, land-use regression, Kriging, and data fusion of chemical transport models with monitoring data. Each of these methods has both strengths and weaknesses. Combining those complementary approaches could improve model performance. Meanwhile, satellite-based total column ozone, combined with ozone vertical profile, is another potential input. The authors propose a hybrid model that integrates the above variables to achieve spatially and temporally resolved exposure assessments for ground-level ozone. The authors used a neural network for its capacity to model interactions and nonlinearity. Convolutional layers, which use convolution kernels to aggregate nearby information, were added to the neural network to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. The authors trained the model with the Air Quality System (AQS) 8-hr daily maximum ozone in the continental United States from 2000 to 2012 and tested it with left out monitoring sites. Cross-validated R2 on the left out monitoring sites ranged from 0.74 to 0.80 (mean 0.76) for predictions on 1 km × 1 km grid cells, which indicates good model performance. Model performance remains good even at low ozone concentrations. The prediction results facilitate epidemiological studies to assess the health effect of ozone in the long term and the short term. Implications: Ozone monitors do not provide full data coverage over the United States, which is an obstacle to assess the health effect of ozone when monitoring data are not available. This paper used a hybrid approach to combine satellite-based ozone measurements, chemical transport model simulations, land-use terms, and other auxiliary variables to obtain spatially and temporally resolved ground-level ozone estimation.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric ozone plays a pivotal role in Earth's climate system, influencing solar radiation absorption in the stratosphere and regulating ultraviolet light reaching the surface. Accurate monitoring of ozone concentration is crucial for environmental assessments, air quality monitoring, and climate change studies. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provide valuable data for such monitoring. While OMI offers a long data record since 2004, but its effectiveness is hindered by its limitations in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, stemming from satellite hardware and retrieval algorithms. Sentinel-5P TROPOMI provides higher spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio, nevertheless, data record from it is rather short. Harmonizing these two datasets by taking the best use of their specific advantages is essential for creating a comprehensive and accurate atmospheric ozone concentration dataset. To maximize the advantages of these multi-source data products, our method utilizes a neural network to learn the mapping relationship between OMI and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI ozone column concentration products, constructing a harmonized model that optimizes the spatial and temporal sequence of historical OMI ozone column concentrations while considering topographic factors. The reconstructed ozone column concentration product is a long time series with the high spatial resolution and accuracy characteristics of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI. This research leverages powerful nonlinear modeling and spatial feature mapping capabilities based on deep learning networks to create a harmonized dataset of atmospheric ozone column concentrations, offering a comprehensive understanding of ozone distribution across the Tibetan Plateau. This dataset not only improves accuracy and precision in ozone concentration measurements but also facilitates in-depth analysis of local ozone variations, providing reliable dataset for scientific investigations into the atmospheric environment. The complete dataset is openly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10430751.},

However, few studies have attempted to use satellite retrieved ozone as an indicator given their low sensitivity in the boundary layer. Using the Troposphere Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)'s total ozone column together with the ozone profile information retrieved by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), as TROPOMI ozone profile product has not been released, we developed a machine learning model to estimate daily maximum 8-hour average ground-level ozone concentration at 10 km spatial resolution in California. In addition to satellite parameters, we included meteorological fields from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) system at 3 km resolution and land-use information as predictors. Our model achieved an overall 10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.84 with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0059 ppm, indicating a good agreement between model predictions and observations. Model predictions showed that the suburb of Los Angeles Metropolitan area had the highest ozone levels, while the Bay Area and the Pacific coast had the lowest. High ozone levels are also seen in Southern California and along the east side of the Central Valley. TROPOMI data improved the estimate of extreme values when compared to a similar model without it. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and value of using TROPOMI data in the spatiotemporal characterization of ground-level ozone concentration.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposure to surface ozone (O3) has become a major public health concern. To accurately estimate the spatial-coverage O3 from sparse ground-truth data, we here propose a two-stage, deep learning model, “the explainable and spatial dependence deep learning model (ExDLM)”, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), and integrated gradients (IG). Compared to individual CNN and DNN, our model showed higher accuracy and exhibited the highest R2 of 0.78 and the lowest RMSE of 18.35 μg/m3. The estimated O3 was 66.19 ± 33.87 μg/m3 as compared to the 69.51 ± 39.38 μg/m3 calculated using the ground-truth data. Using ExDLM, we interpreted the contribution of nearby cities to O3 in Beijing during extreme weather (dust storms) and clean days. During dust storms, the surrounding dust cells had negative IG scores, ranging from −1.43 to −0.01, indicating that these areas inhibited the formation of O3 in Beijing. Conversely, in clean days, especially during summer when O3 pollution is often extreme, the surrounding cells had positive scores, indicating that these areas enhanced O3 formation. Nearby cities had the highest scores, ranging from 0.05 to 0.11. Using the proposed model, we were able to assess O3 dynamics in Beijing, with greater temporal and spatial accuracy than that achieved by current models. The ExDLM also allows for finer-scale analysis of O3 pollution, even under dust storms conditions, which traditionally limit model accuracy, as well as great spatial interpretability.},

	abstract = {The limited number of ozone monitoring stations imposes uncertainty in various applications, calling for accurate approaches to capturing ozone values in all regions, particularly those with no in-situ measurements. This study uses deep learning (DL) to accurately estimate daily maximum 8-hr average (MDA8) ozone and examines the spatial contribution of several factors on ozone levels over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) in 2019. A comparison between in-situ observations and DL-estimated MDA8 ozone values shows a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95, an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.97, and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 2.79 ppb, highlighting the promising performance of the deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN) at estimating surface MDA8 ozone. Spatial cross-validation also confirms the high spatial accuracy of the model, which obtains an R of 0.91, and IOA of 0.96 and an MAB of 3.46 ppb when it is trained and tested on separate stations. To interpret the black-box nature of our DL model, we use Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to generate a spatial feature contribution map (SFCM), the results of which confirm an advanced ability of Deep-CNN to capture the interactions between most predictor variables and ozone. For instance, the model shows that solar radiation (SRad) SFCM, with higher values, enhances the formation of ozone, particularly in the south and southwestern CONUS. As SRad triggers ozone precursors to produce ozone via photochemical reactions, it increases ozone concentrations. The model also shows that humidity, with its low values, increases ozone concentrations in the western mountainous regions. The negative correlation between humidity and ozone levels can be attributed to factors such as higher ozone decomposition resulting from increased levels of humidity and OH radicals. This study is the first to introduce the SFCM to investigate the spatial role of predictor variables on changes in estimated MDA8 ozone levels.},

This discussion entails a review of state-of-the-art machine learning concepts and their applicability to weather data with its pertinent statistical properties.

In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that machine learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid physics have the potential to accelerate and even outperform conventional physics-based schemes. However, as the ML models are commonly implemented using the ML libraries written in Python, very few ML-based parameterizations have been successfully integrated with NWP models due to the difficulty of embedding Python functions into Fortran-based NWP models. To address this issue, we developed a coupler to allow the ML-based parameterizations to be coupled with a widely used NWP model, i.e., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Similar to the WRF I/O methodologies, the coupler provides the options to run the ML model inference with exclusive processors or the same processors for WRF calculations. In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the coupler, the ML-based radiation emulators are trained and coupled with the WRF model successfully.},

There has been increasing interest from technology companies, government institutions, and meteorological agencies in building digital twins of the Earth. Recent approaches using transformers, physics-informed machine learning, and graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on relatively narrow spatiotemporal scales and specific tasks. With the recent success of generative artificial intelligence (AI) using pre-trained transformers for language modeling and vision with prompt engineering and fine-tuning, we are now moving towards generalizable AI. In particular, we are witnessing the rise of AI foundation models that can perform competitively on multiple domain-specific downstream tasks. Despite this progress, we are still in the nascent stages of a generalizable AI model for global Earth system models, regional climate models, and mesoscale weather models. Here, we review current state-of-the-art AI approaches, primarily from transformer and operator learning literature in the context of meteorology. We provide our perspective on criteria for success towards a family of foundation models for nowcasting and forecasting weather and climate predictions. We also discuss how such models can perform competitively on downstream tasks such as downscaling (super-resolution), identifying conditions conducive to the occurrence of wildfires, and predicting consequential meteorological phenomena across various spatiotemporal scales such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers. In particular, we examine current AI methodologies and contend they have matured enough to design and implement a weather foundation model.},

	abstract = {A major computational barrier in global modeling of atmospheric chemistry is the numerical integration of the coupled kinetic equations describing the chemical mechanism. Machine-learned (ML) solvers can offer order of magnitude speedup relative to conventional implicit solvers but past implementations have suffered from fast error growth and only run for short simulation times ({\textless}1 month). A successful ML solver for global models must avoid error growth over yearlong simulations and allow for reinitialization of the chemical trajectory by transport at every time step. Here, we explore the capability of a neural network solver equipped with an autoencoder to achieve stable full-year simulations of tropospheric oxidant chemistry in the global 3-D Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem model, replacing its standard mechanism (228 species) by the Super-Fast mechanism (12 species) to avoid the curse of dimensionality. We find that online training of the ML solver within GEOS-Chem is important for accuracy, whereas offline training from archived GEOS-Chem inputs/outputs produces large errors. After online training, we achieve stable 1-year simulations with five-fold speedup compared to the standard implicit Rosenbrock solver with global tropospheric normalized mean biases of −0.3\% for ozone, 1\% for hydrogen oxide radicals, and −5\% for nitrogen oxides. The ML solver captures the diurnal and synoptic variability of surface ozone at polluted and clean sites. There are however large regional biases for ozone and NOx under remote conditions where chemical aging leads to error accumulation. These regional biases remain a major limitation for practical application, and ML emulation would be more difficult in a more complex mechanism.},

The feature importance results show that cloud optical depth (COD), relative humidity, and precipitation are the top three factors affecting CTM high biases. Such results indicate that the high ozone biases in summer over China mainly occur on wet/cloudy days (∼40\% biased high), while biases on dry/clear days are small (within 5\%). We link the important features with model parameterizations and variables, identifying model underestimates in the dry deposition velocity and COD on wet/cloudy days. By accounting for the enhanced dry deposition on wet plant cuticles and using satellite observation constrained COD, we find that CTM high ozone biases can be halved with an improved agreement in the temporal variability, highlighting the effects of dry deposition and COD on ozone, as suggested by the RF outcomes.},

	abstract = {Modeling atmospheric chemistry is computationally expensive and limits the widespread use of atmospheric chemical transport models. This computational cost arises from solving high-dimensional systems of stiff differential equations. Previous work has demonstrated the promise of machine learning (ML) to accelerate air quality model simulations but has suffered from numerical instability during long-term simulations. This may be because previous ML-based efforts have relied on explicit Euler time integration – which is known to be unstable for stiff systems – and have used neural networks which are prone to overfitting. We hypothesize that the creation of parsimonious models combined with modern numerical integration techniques can overcome this limitation. Using a small-scale photochemical mechanism to explore the potential of these methods, we have created a machine-learned surrogate by (1) reducing dimensionality using singular value decomposition to create an interpretably-compressed low-dimensional latent space, and (2) using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to create a differential-equation-based representation of the underlying chemical dynamics in the compressed latent space with reduced numerical stiffness. The root mean square error of the ML model prediction for ozone concentration over nine days is 37.8\% of the root mean concentration across all simulations in our testing dataset. The surrogate model is 11\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster with 12\${\textbackslash}times\$ fewer integration timesteps compared to the reference model and is numerically stable in all tested simulations. Overall, we find that SINDy can be used to create fast, stable, and accurate surrogates of a simple photochemical mechanism. In future work, we will explore the application of this method to more detailed mechanisms and their use in large-scale simulations.},

Therefore, atmospheric air quality monitoring systems were found to monitor and predict ozone concentration. Due to complex formation of ozone influenced by precursors of ozone (O3) and meteorological conditions, there is a need to examine and evaluate various machine learning (ML) models for ozone concentration prediction. This study aims to utilize various ML models including Linear Regression (LR), Tree Regression (TR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Ensemble Regression (ER), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Artificial Neural Networks Models (ANN) to predict tropospheric (O3) using ozone concentration dataset. The dataset was created by observing hourly average data from air quality monitoring systems in 3 different stations including Putrajaya, Kelang, and KL in 3 sites in Peninsular Malaysia. The prediction models have been trained on this dataset and validated by optimizing their hyperparameters. Additionally, the performance of models was evaluated in terms of RMSE, MAE, R2, and training time. The results indicated that LR, SVR, GPR and ANN were able to give the highest R2 (83 \% and 89 \%) with specific hyperparameters in stations Kelang and KL, respectively. On the other hand, SVR and ER outweigh other models in terms of R2 (79 \%) in Putrajaya station. Overall, regardless slightly performance differences, several developed models were able to learn patterns well and provide good prediction performance in terms of R2, RMSE and MAE. Ensemble regression models were found to balance between high prediction accuracy in terms of R2 and low training time and thus considered as a feasible solution for application of Ozone concentration prediction using the data in hourly scenario.},

	abstract = {Explicit gas-phase chemical mechanisms represent the state of knowledge regarding the chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are crucial in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). However, these chemical mechanisms are computationally expensive, which limits their practical use in large-scale air quality modeling. Mechanism reduction is therefore required for computational efficiency while preserving the accuracy of the detailed gas-phase chemical mechanisms. This paper presents a new version of the Generator of Reduced Organic Aerosol Mechanisms (GENOA v2.0), which reduces mechanisms at a size suitable for three-dimensional (3-D) modeling while preserving the accuracy of detailed chemical mechanisms for simulating aerosol concentrations. GENOA v2.0 adopts a parallel reduction framework to identify the most optimal reductions from competitive candidates, and can reduce chemical mechanisms from multiple aerosol precursors. To demonstrate the reduction efficiency, GENOA v2.0 is applied to the reduction of monoterpene chemistry from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) combined with the Peroxy Radical Autoxidation Mechanism (PRAM) mechanism. The original mechanism, consisting of 3 001 reactions and 1 227 species (including 738 condensable species), is reduced by 93\% to 197 reactions and 110 species (including 23 condensable species), inducing an average error of only 3\% in aerosol concentrations. Sensitivity tests showed that this reduced mechanism behaved similarly to the original mechanism in response to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, and SOA mass loading. Moreover, if the error tolerance is increased to 20\% — which can still be acceptable for 3-D air quality modeling — the mechanism can be further simplified to 40 reactions and 24 species (including 5 condensable species). Consequently, the GENOA-generated aerosol mechanism preserves the complexity of the detailed gas-phase chemical mechanisms on SOA formation while increasing computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for most environmental conditions encountered in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Gas-phase oxidation of isoprene by ozone (O3) and the hydroxyl (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals significantly impacts tropospheric oxidant levels and secondary organic aerosol formation. The most comprehensive and up-to-date chemical mechanism for isoprene oxidation consists of several hundred species and over 800 reactions. Therefore, the computational expense of including the entire mechanism in large-scale atmospheric chemical transport models is usually prohibitive, and most models employ reduced isoprene mechanisms ranging in size from ∼ 10 to ∼ 200 species. We have developed a new reduced isoprene oxidation mechanism using a directed-graph path-based automated model reduction approach, with minimal manual adjustment of the output mechanism. The approach takes as inputs a full isoprene oxidation mechanism, the environmental parameter space, and a list of priority species which are protected from elimination during the reduction process. Our reduced mechanism, AMORE-Isoprene (where AMORE stands for Automated Model Reduction), consists of 12 species which are unique to the isoprene mechanism as well as 22 reactions. We demonstrate its performance in a box model in comparison with experimental data from the literature and other current isoprene oxidation mechanisms. AMORE-Isoprene's performance with respect to predicting the time evolution of isoprene oxidation products, including isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) and formaldehyde, is favorable compared with other similarly sized mechanisms. When AMORE-Isoprene is included in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism 1.0 (CRACMM1AMORE) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ, v5.3.3), O3 and formaldehyde agreement with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System observations is improved. O3 bias is reduced by 3.4 ppb under daytime conditions for O3 concentrations over 50 ppb. Formaldehyde bias is reduced by 0.26 ppb on average for all formaldehyde measurements compared with the base CRACMM1. There was no significant change in computation time between CRACMM1AMORE and the base CRACMM. AMORE-Isoprene shows a 35 \% improvement in agreement between simulated IEPOX concentrations and chamber data over the base CRACMM1 mechanism when compared in the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM) box model framework. This work demonstrates a new highly reduced isoprene mechanism and shows the potential value of automated model reduction for complex reaction systems.},

	abstract = {Models of atmospheric phenomena provide insight into climate, air quality, and meteorology and provide a mechanism for understanding the effect of future emissions scenarios. To accurately represent atmospheric phenomena, these models consume vast quantities of computational resources. Machine learning (ML) techniques such as neural networks have the potential to emulate computationally intensive components of these models to reduce their computational burden. However, such ML surrogate models may lead to nonphysical predictions that are difficult to uncover. Here we present a neural network architecture that enforces conservation laws to numerical precision. Instead of simply predicting properties of interest, a physically interpretable hidden layer within the network predicts fluxes between properties which are subsequently related to the properties of interest. This approach is readily generalizable to physical processes where flux continuity is an essential governing equation. As an example application, we demonstrate our approach on a neural network surrogate model of photochemistry, trained to emulate a reference model that simulates formation and reaction of ozone. We design a physics-constrained neural network surrogate model of photochemistry using this approach and find that it conserves atoms as they flow between molecules while outperforming two other neural network architectures in terms of accuracy, physical consistency, and non-negativity of concentrations.},

	abstract = {The chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS uses a volatility basis set (VBS) approach to represent the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. Inclusion of the VBS approximately doubles the dimensionality of LOTOS-EUROS and slows computation of the advection operator by a factor of two. This complexity limits SOA representation in operational forecasts. We develop a mass-conserving dimensionality reduction method based on matrix factorization to find latent patterns in the VBS tracers that correspond to a smaller set of superspecies. Tracers are reversibly compressed to superspecies before transport, and the superspecies are subsequently decompressed to tracers for process-based SOA modeling. This physically interpretable data-driven method conserves the total concentration and phase of the tracers throughout the process. The superspecies approach is implemented in LOTOS-EUROS and found to accelerate the advection operator by a factor of 1.5–1.8. Concentrations remain numerically stable over model simulation times of 2 weeks, including simulations at higher spatial resolutions than the data-driven models were trained on. The reversible compression of VBS tracers enables detailed, process-based SOA representation in LOTOS-EUROS operational forecasts in a computationally efficient manner. Beyond this case study, the physically consistent data-driven approach developed in this work enforces conservation laws that are essential to other Earth system modeling applications, and generalizes to other processes where computational benefit can be gained from a two-way mapping between detailed process variables and their representation in a reduced-dimensional space.},

The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features. In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space with a smaller number of observations.},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed from oxidation of hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources. Accurate predictions of this chemistry are key for air quality and climate studies due to the large contribution of organic aerosols to submicron aerosol mass. Currently, only explicit models, such as the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A), can fully represent the chemical processing of thousands of organic species. However, their extreme computational cost prohibits their use in current chemistry-climate models, which rely on simplified empirical parameterizations to predict SOA concentrations. This study demonstrates that machine learning can accurately emulate SOA formation from an explicit chemistry model with an approximate error of 2\%–8\%, up to five days for several precursors and for potentially up to one month for recurrent neural network models, and with 100 to 100,000 times speedup over GECKO-A, making it computationally useable in a chemistry-climate model. We generated the training data using thousands of GECKO-A box simulations sampled from a broad range of initial environmental conditions, and focused on three representative SOA precursors: the oxidation by OH of two anthropogenic (toluene, dodecane), and the oxidation by O3 of one biogenic VOC (α-pinene). We compare several neural models and quantify their underlying uncertainty and robustness. These are promising results, suggesting that neural network models could be applied to predict SOA in chemistry-climate models, limited however to the range of environmental conditions that were considered in the training datasets.},

	abstract = {We developed and applied a machine-learned discretization for one-dimensional (1-D) horizontal passive scalar advection, which is an operator component common to all chemical transport models (CTMs). Our learned advection scheme resembles a second-order accuracy, three-stencil numerical solver, but differs from a traditional solver in that coefficients for each equation term are output by a neural network rather than being theoretically-derived constants. We downsampled higher-resolution simulation results – resulting in up to 16\${\textbackslash}times\$ larger grid size and 64\${\textbackslash}times\$ larger timestep – and trained our neural network-based scheme to match the downsampled integration data. In this way, we created an operator that is low-resolution (in time or space) but can reproduce the behavior of a high-resolution traditional solver. Our model shows high fidelity in reproducing its training dataset (a single 10-day 1-D simulation) and is similarly accurate in simulations with unseen initial conditions, wind fields, and grid spacing. In many cases, our learned solver is more accurate than a low-resolution version of the reference solver, but the low-resolution reference solver achieves greater computational speedup (500\${\textbackslash}times\$ acceleration) over the high-resolution simulation than the learned solver is able to (18\${\textbackslash}times\$ acceleration). Surprisingly, our learned 1-D scheme – when combined with a splitting technique – can be used to predict 2-D advection, and is in some cases more stable and accurate than the low-resolution reference solver in 2-D. Overall, our results suggest that learned advection operators may offer a higher-accuracy method for accelerating CTM simulations as compared to simply running a traditional integrator at low resolution.},

Model performance is found to be similar when the variation in major precursors (CO and NOx) were included in the model, instead of the meteorology. Further the inclusion of both precursors and meteorology improved the performance significantly (r2 = 0.86) and the model could also capture the outliers, which are crucial for air quality assessments.

	abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of ozone in climate change simulations, for example concerning global warming projections and atmospheric dynamics. However, fully interactive atmospheric chemistry schemes needed for calculating changes in ozone are computationally expensive. Climate modelers therefore often use climatological ozone fields, which are typically neither consistent with the actual climate state simulated by each model nor with the specific climate change scenario. This limitation applies in particular to standard modeling experiments such as preindustrial control or abrupt 4xCO2 climate sensitivity simulations. Here we suggest a novel method using a simple linear machine learning regression algorithm to predict ozone distributions for preindustrial and abrupt 4xCO2 simulations. Using the atmospheric temperature field as the only input, the regression reliably predicts three-dimensional ozone distributions at monthly to daily time intervals. In particular, the representation of stratospheric ozone variability is much improved compared with a fixed climatology, which is important for interactions with dynamical phenomena such as the polar vortices and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Our method requires training data covering only a fraction of the usual length of simulations and thus promises to be an important stepping stone towards a range of new computationally efficient methods to consider ozone changes in long climate simulations. We highlight key development steps to further improve and extend the scope of machine learning-based ozone parameterizations.},

We here develop a deep learning model to demonstrate the feasibility of ozone bias correction in a global chemistry–climate model. We apply this approach to identify the key factors causing ozone biases and to correct projections of future surface ozone. Temperature and the related geographic variables latitude and month show the strongest relationship with ozone biases. This indicates that ozone biases are sensitive to temperature and suggests weaknesses in representation of temperature-sensitive physical or chemical processes. Photolysis rates are also an important factor, highlighting the sensitivity of biases to simulated cloud cover and insolation. Atmospheric chemical species such as the hydroxyl radical, nitric acid and peroxyacyl nitrate show strong positive relationships with ozone biases on a regional scale. These relationships reveal the conditions under which ozone biases occur, although they reflect association rather than direct causation. We correct model projections of future ozone under different climate and emission scenarios following the shared socio-economic pathways. We find that changes in seasonal ozone mixing ratios from the present day to the future are generally smaller than those simulated without bias correction, especially in high-emission regions. This suggests that the ozone sensitivity to changing emissions and climate may be overestimated with chemistry–climate models. Given the uncertainty in simulating future ozone, we show that deep learning approaches can provide improved assessment of the impacts of climate and emission changes on future air quality, along with valuable information to guide future model development.},

A comprehensive data set was created based on thousands of individual detailed simulations, randomly initialized to account for the variety of atmospheric chemical environments. Recurrent random forests were trained to predict organic matter formation from dodecane and toluene precursors, and the partitioning between gas and particle phases. Validation tests show that the random forests perform well without any divergence over 10 days of simulations. The distribution of errors shows that the sampling of initial conditions for the training simulations needs to focus on chemical regimes where SOA production is the most sensitive. Sensitivity tests show that specializing multiple random forests for a specific chemical regime is not more efficient than training a single general random forest for the entire data set. The most important predictors are those providing information about the chemical regime, oxidants levels, and existing organic mass. The choice of predictors is crucial as using too many unimportant predictors reduces the performances of the random forests.},

This study uses ground-level maximum daily 8-hour ozone average (MDA8 O3) as an example to examine O3 responses to local anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions in Taiwan by Response Surface Modeling (RSM). Three different datasets for RSM were examined, including the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model data, ML-measurement-model fusion (ML-MMF) data, and ML data, which respectively represent direct numerical model predictions, numerical predictions adjusted by observations and other auxiliary data, and ML predictions based on observations and other auxiliary data. The results show that both ML-MMF (r = 0.93–0.94) and ML predictions (r = 0.89–0.94) present significantly improved performance in the benchmark case compared with CMAQ predictions (r = 0.41–0.80). While ML-MMF isopleths exhibit O3 nonlinearity close to actual responses due to their numerical base and observation-based correction, ML isopleths present biased predictions concerning their different controlled ranges of O3 and distorted O3 responses to NOx and VOC emission ratios compared with ML-MMF isopleths, which implies that using data without support from CMAQ modeling to predict the air quality could mislead the controlled targets and future trends. Meanwhile, the observation-corrected ML-MMF isopleths also emphasize the impact of transboundary pollution from mainland China on the regional O3 sensitivity to local NOx and VOC emissions, which transboundary NOx would make all air quality regions in April more sensitive to local VOC emissions and limit the potential effort by reducing local emissions. Future ML applications in atmospheric science like forecasting or bias correction should provide interpretability and explainability, except for meeting statistical performance and providing variable importance. Assessment with interpretable physical and chemical mechanisms and constructing a statistically robust ML model should be equally important.},

The model has been trained on 22 yr of ozone and nitrogen oxides in situ measurements and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2000 to 2021 at 328 stations in central Europe located in rural and suburban environments. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service regional forecast model ensemble for ground-level ozone with respect to the mean-square error and mean absolute error of the daily maximum 8-h running-average ozone, thus marking a major milestone for DL-based ozone prediction. O3ResNet has a very small bias without requiring additional postprocessing, and it generalizes well so that new stations can be added with no need to retrain the neural network. Because the model works on hourly data, it can be easily adapted to output other air quality metrics. We conclude that O3ResNet is sufficiently advanced and robust to become a test application for operational air quality forecasting with DL. Significance Statement In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning approach to forecast ground-level ozone for rural and suburban environments on a local scale. Our model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service regional ensemble forecast and is a major milestone toward a more reliable ozone prediction. This is important because local-scale ozone forecasts using conventional methods show significant bias or require site-dependent postprocessing. The findings suggest that the model presented in this article can become an important tool for air quality prediction.},

The approach uses neural networks as a statistical or machine learning technique for an accurate and fast emulation or statistical approximation of model physics parameterizations. It is applied to development of an accurate and fast approximation of an atmospheric longwave radiation parameterization for the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model, which is the most time consuming component of model physics. The developed neural network emulation is two orders of magnitude, 50–80 times, faster than the original parameterization. A comparison of the parallel 10-yr climate simulations performed with the original parameterization and its neural network emulations confirmed that these simulations produce almost identical results. The obtained results show the conceptual and practical possibility of an efficient synergetic combination of deterministic and statistical learning components within an atmospheric climate or forecast model. A developmental framework and practical validation criteria for neural network emulations of model physics components are outlined.},

	abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

	abstract = {Ground-level ozone (GLO) has been widely recognized as a critical air pollutant that has the potential to induce various adverse environmental and health effects. To eliminate its hazardous impacts, the development of an accurate and effective approach to forecast the upcoming pollution concentration levels is in urgent need. Recent studies show that machine learning algorithms have excellent abilities in ground-level ozone concentration forecasting, however many of their forecasting models do not consider the contributing effects on meteorological measurements and traffic situations which were also identified as potential influencing factors to ground-level ozone concentration by some previous research. In the meantime, most of the existing models target short-term forecasting with rough temporal resolutions, such as daily and weekly scales. This paper aims to propose a methodology that can provide long-term GLO concentration forecasting with a high temporal resolution. To achieve this, a frequent pattern mining approach is utilized to analyze the local intercorrelation between GLO concentration and contributing factors such as meteorological parameters and transportation situations. Then, a series of machine learning algorithms were identified to forecast the ground-level ozone concentration levels using traffic and meteorological measurements data. A case study was conducted in the Houston region with 10 years of historical measurements, each of the historical ground-level ozone concentration records is associated with a series of meteorology and traffic situation parameters. Data from 2010 to 2019 was used to select and train the machine learning models, and data from 2020 was used to perform the final validation and evaluation. Results show that the extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm provides the most accurate prediction of the hourly ground-level ozone concentration on a yearly scale, which shows the annually forecasting ability and the robustness of the model built. The proposed approach could be applied to other similar regions and other critical air pollutants that are also influenced by transportation and meteorological factors.},

	abstract = {Surface ozone pollution in South Korea has increased over the past 2 decades, despite efforts to decrease emissions, and is pervasively in exceedance of the maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) standard of 60 ppb. Here, we investigate the 2015–2019 trends in surface ozone and NO2 concentrations over South Korea and the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA), focusing on the 90th percentile MDA8 ozone as an air quality metric. We use a random forest algorithm to remove the effect of meteorological variability on the 2015–2019 trends and find an ozone increase of up to 1.5 ppb a−1 in April–May, while NO2 decreases by 22 \%. Global 3-D atmospheric chemistry model simulations including recent chemical updates can successfully simulate surface ozone over South Korea and China as well as the very high free-tropospheric ozone observed above 2 km altitude (mean 75 ppb in May–June) and can reproduce the observed 2015–2019 emission-driven ozone trend over the SMA including its seasonality. Further investigation of the model trend for May, when meteorology-corrected ozone and its increase are the highest, reveals that a decrease in South Korea NOx emissions is the main driver for the SMA ozone increase. Although this result implies that decreasing volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions is necessary to decrease ozone, we find that ozone would still remain above 80 ppb even if all anthropogenic emissions in South Korea were shut off. China contributes only 8 ppb to this elevated South Korea background, and ship emissions contribute only a few parts per billion. Zeroing out all anthropogenic emissions in East Asia in the model indicates a remarkably high external background of 56 ppb, consistent with the high concentrations observed in the free troposphere, implying that the air quality standard in South Korea is not practically achievable unless this background external to East Asia can be decreased.},

We develop a predictor for the bias in tropospheric ozone (O3, a key pollutant) calculated by an atmospheric chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem), based on outputs from the model and observations of ozone from both the surface (EPA, EMEP, and GAW) and the ozone-sonde networks. We train a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) to predict model bias (model divided by observation), with model and observational data for 2010–2015, and then we test the approach using the years 2016–2017. We show that the bias-corrected model performs considerably better than the uncorrected model. The root-mean-square error is reduced from 16.2 to 7.5\&thinsp;ppb, the normalized mean bias is reduced from 0.28 to −0.04, and Pearson's R is increased from 0.48 to 0.84. Comparisons with observations from the NASA ATom flights (which were not included in the training) also show improvements but to a smaller extent, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 12.1 to 10.5\&thinsp;ppb, reducing the normalized mean bias (NMB) from 0.08 to 0.06, and increasing Pearson's R from 0.76 to 0.79. We attribute the smaller improvements to the lack of routine observational constraints for much of the remote troposphere. We show that the method is robust to variations in the volume of training data, with approximately a year of data needed to produce useful performance. Data denial experiments (removing observational sites from the algorithm training) show that information from one location (for example Europe) can reduce the model bias over other locations (for example North America) which might provide insights into the processes controlling the model bias. We explore the choice of predictor (bias prediction versus direct prediction) and conclude both may have utility. We conclude that combining machine learning approaches with process-based models may provide a useful tool for improving these models.},

	abstract = {Large air quality models and large climate models simulate the physical and chemical properties of the ocean, land surface, and/or atmosphere to predict atmospheric composition, energy balance and the future of our planet. All of these models employ some form of operator splitting, also called the method of fractional steps, in their structure, which enables each physical or chemical process to be simulated in a separate operator or module within the overall model. In this structure, each of the modules calculates property changes for a fixed period of time; that is, property values are passed into the module, which calculates how they change for a period of time and then returns the new property values, all in round-robin between the various modules of the model. Some of these modules require the vast majority of the computer resources consumed by the entire model, so increasing their computational efficiency can either improve the model's computational performance, enable more realistic physical or chemical representations in the module, or a combination of these two. Recent efforts have attempted to replace these modules with ones that use machine learning tools to memorize the input–output relationships of the most time-consuming modules. One shortcoming of some of the original modules and their machine-learned replacements is lack of adherence to conservation principles that are essential to model performance. In this work, we derive a mathematical framework for machine-learned replacements that conserves properties – say mass, atoms, or energy – to machine precision. This framework can be used to develop machine-learned operator replacements in environmental models.},

	abstract = {Warm-sector heavy rainfall along the south China coast poses significant forecasting challenges due to its localized nature and prolonged duration. To improve the prediction of such high-impact weather events, high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are increasingly used to more accurately represent topographic effects. However, as these models' grid spacing approaches the scale of convective processes, they enter a “gray zone”, where the models struggle to fully resolve the turbulent eddies within the atmospheric boundary layer, necessitating partial parameterization. The appropriateness of applying convection parameterization (CP) schemes within this gray zone remains controversial. To address this, scale-aware CP schemes have been developed to improve the representation of convective transport. Among these, the multi-scale Kain–Fritsch (MSKF) scheme enhances the traditional Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme, incorporating modifications that facilitate its effective application at spatial resolutions as high as 2 km. In recent years, there has been an increase in the application of machine learning (ML) models across various domains of atmospheric sciences, including efforts to replace conventional physical parameterizations with ML models. This work introduces a multi-output bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model intended to replace the scale-aware MSKF CP scheme. This multi-output Bi-LSTM model is capable of simultaneously predicting the convection trigger while also modeling the associated convective tendencies and precipitation rates with a high performance. Data for training and testing the model are generated using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model over south China at a horizontal resolution of 5 km. Furthermore, this work evaluates the performance of the WRF model coupled with the ML-based CP scheme against simulations with the traditional MSKF scheme. The results demonstrate that the Bi-LSTM model can achieve high accuracy, indicating the promising potential of ML models to substitute the MSKF scheme in the gray zone.},

	abstract = {Global modeling of atmospheric chemistry is a great computational challenge because of the cost of integrating the kinetic equations for chemical mechanisms with typically over 100 coupled species. Here we present an adaptive algorithm to ease this computational bottleneck with no significant loss in accuracy and apply it to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model for tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (228 species, 724 reactions). Our approach is inspired by unsupervised machine learning clustering techniques and traditional asymptotic analysis ideas. We locally define species in the mechanism as fast or slow on the basis of their total production and loss rates, and we solve the coupled kinetic system only for the fast species assembled in a submechanism of the full mechanism. To avoid computational overhead, we first partition the species from the full mechanism into 13 blocks, using a machine learning approach that analyzes the chemical linkages between species and their correlated presence as fast or slow in the global model domain. Building on these blocks, we then preselect 20 submechanisms, as defined by unique assemblages of the species blocks, and then pick locally and on the fly which submechanism to use in the model based on local chemical conditions. In each submechanism, we isolate slow species and slow reactions from the coupled system of fast species to be solved. Because many species in the full mechanism are important only in source regions, we find that we can reduce the effective size of the mechanism by 70 \% globally without sacrificing complexity where/when it is needed. The computational cost of the chemical integration decreases by 50 \% with relative biases smaller than 2 \% for important species over 8-year simulations. Changes to the full mechanism including the addition of new species can be accommodated by adding these species to the relevant blocks without having to reconstruct the suite of submechanisms.},

We present an adaptive method to greatly reduce the computational cost of that numerical integration in global 3-D models while maintaining high accuracy. Most of the atmosphere does not in fact require solving for the full chemical complexity of the mechanism, so considerable simplification is possible if one can recognize the dynamic continuum of chemical complexity required across the atmospheric domain. We do this by constructing a limited set of reduced chemical mechanisms (chemical regimes) to cover the range of atmospheric conditions and then pick locally and on the fly which mechanism to use for a given grid box and time step on the basis of computed production and loss rates for individual species. Application to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model for oxidant–aerosol chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere (full mechanism of 228 species) is presented. We show that 20 chemical regimes can largely encompass the range of conditions encountered in the model. Results from a 2-year GEOS-Chem simulation shows that our method can reduce the computational cost of chemical integration by 30\&thinsp;\%–40\&thinsp;\% while maintaining accuracy better than 1\&thinsp;\% and with no error growth. Our method retains the full complexity of the original chemical mechanism where it is needed, provides the same model output diagnostics (species production and loss rates, reaction rates) as the full mechanism, and can accommodate changes in the chemical mechanism or in model resolution without having to reconstruct the chemical regimes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric chemistry models?components in models that simulate air pollution and climate change?are computationally expensive. Previous studies have shown that machine-learned atmospheric chemical solvers can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional integration methods but tend to suffer from numerical instability. Here, we present a modeling framework that reduces error accumulation compared to previous work while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach is novel in that it (1) uses a recurrent training regime that results in extended ({\textgreater}1 week) simulations without exponential error accumulation and (2) can reversibly compress the number of modeled chemical species by {\textgreater}80\% without further decreasing accuracy. We observe an {\textasciitilde}260? speedup ({\textasciitilde}1,900? with specialized hardware) compared to the traditional solver. We use random initial conditions in training to promote general applicability across a wide range of atmospheric conditions. For ozone (concentrations ranging from 0?70 ppb), our model predictions over a 24-hr simulation period match those of the reference solver with median error of 2.7 and {\textless}19 ppb error across 99\% of simulations initialized with random noise. Error can be significantly higher in the remaining 1\% of simulations, which include extreme concentration fluctuations simulated by the reference model. Results are similar for total particulate matter (median error of 16 and {\textless}32 ?g/m3 across 99\% of simulations with concentrations ranging from 0?150 ?g/m3). Finally, we discuss practical implications of our modeling framework and next steps for improvements. The machine learning models described here are not yet replacements for traditional chemistry solvers but represent a step toward that goal.},

Our training data consist of 1 month (July 2013) of output of chemical conditions together with the model physical state, produced from the GEOS-Chem chemistry model v10. From this data set we train random forest regression models to predict the concentration of each transported species after the integrator, based on the physical and chemical conditions before the integrator. The choice of prediction type has a strong impact on the skill of the regression model. We find best results from predicting the change in concentration for long-lived species and the absolute concentration for short-lived species. We also find improvements from a simple implementation of chemical families ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO$_{\textrm{\textit{x}}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;NO\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}NO₂{\textless}/span{\textgreater}).{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We then implement the trained random forest predictors back into GEOS-Chem to replace the numerical integrator.

The biases become largest in remote areas such as the tropical Pacific where errors in the chemistry can accumulate with little balancing influence from emissions or deposition.

Offline chemical transport models (CTMs), where the chemical continuity equations are solved using meteorological data as input, have usability advantages and are important vehicles for developing atmospheric chemistry knowledge that can then be transferred to Earth system models. However, they have generally not been designed to take advantage of massively parallel computing architectures. Here, we develop such a high-performance capability for GEOS-Chem (GCHP), a CTM driven by meteorological data from the NASA Goddard Earth Observation System (GEOS) and used by hundreds of research groups worldwide. GCHP is a grid-independent implementation of GEOS-Chem using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) that permits the same standard model to operate in a distributed-memory framework for massive parallelization. GCHP also allows GEOS-Chem to take advantage of the native GEOS cubed-sphere grid for greater accuracy and computational efficiency in simulating transport.

Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning–based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. —H.

	abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

The hourly data for air pollutants and meteorological variables, obtained both at the surface and at the high elevation (500 hPa) stations of Seoul City for the period of 1989–1999, were analyzed. Two types of forecast models are developed. The first model, Part I, uses a fuzzy expert system and forecasts the possibility of high ozone levels (equal to or above 80 ppb) occurring on the next day. The second model, Part II, uses a neural network system to forecast the daily maximum concentration of ozone on the following day. The forecasting system includes a correction function so that the existing model can be updated whenever a new ozone episode appears. The accuracy of the forecasting system has been improved continuously through verification and augmentation.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10\% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate real-time forecasting of national spatial ozone distribution is critical to the provision of effective early warning. Traditional numerical air quality models require a high computational cost associated with running large-scale numerical simulations. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model (VAE-GAN) combining a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the dynamic ozone distributions in spatial and temporal spaces. The VAE-GAN model can not only decipher the complex nonlinear relationship between the inputs (the past states/ozone and meteorological factors) and outputs (ozone), but also provide ozone forecasts for a long lead-time beyond the training period. The performance of VAE-GAN is demonstrated in hourly and daily spatio-temporal ozone forecasts over China. The training datasets from 2013 to 2017 and validation datasets from 2018 to 2019 are the collection of data from the air quality reanalysis datasets. With the use of VAE, large dataset sizes are decreased by three orders of magnitude, enabling hourly and daily forecasts to be computed in seconds. Results show that the VAE-GAN achieves a reasonable accuracy in the prediction of both the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of hourly and daily ozone fields, as compared to the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (commonly used in China), the reanalysis data and observations during the validation period. Thus, the VAE-GAN is a cost-effective tool for large data-driven predictions, which can potentially reinforce air pollution prediction efforts in providing risk assessment and management in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {Introduction of high-performing crop cultivars and crop/soil water management practices that increase the stomatal uptake of carbon dioxide and photosynthesis will be instrumental in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving food security. To date, however, global assessments of how to increase crop yield have failed to consider the negative effects of tropospheric ozone, a gaseous pollutant that enters the leaf stomatal pores of plants along with carbon dioxide, and is increasing in concentration globally, particularly in rapidly developing countries. Earlier studies have simply estimated that the largest effects are in the areas with the highest ozone concentrations. Using a modelling method that accounts for the effects of soil moisture deficit and meteorological factors on the stomatal uptake of ozone, we show for the first time that ozone impacts on wheat yield are particularly large in humid rain-fed and irrigated areas of major wheat-producing countries (e.g. United States, France, India, China and Russia). Averaged over 2010–2012, we estimate that ozone reduces wheat yields by a mean 9.9\% in the northern hemisphere and 6.2\% in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to some 85 Tg (million tonnes) of lost grain. Total production losses in developing countries receiving Official Development Assistance are 50\% higher than those in developed countries, potentially reducing the possibility of achieving UN SDG2. Crucially, our analysis shows that ozone could reduce the potential yield benefits of increasing irrigation usage in response to climate change because added irrigation increases the uptake and subsequent negative effects of the pollutant. We show that mitigation of air pollution in a changing climate could play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned UN SDG, while also contributing to other SDGs related to human health and well-being, ecosystems and climate change.},

In addition, RF is calculated for ozone fields prepared as an input for CMIP6 models without chemistry schemes and from a chemical transport model simulation. A radiative kernel for ozone is constructed and used to derive the RF. The ozone RF in 2010 (2005–2014) relative to 1850 is 0.35 W m−2 [0.08–0.61] (5–95\% uncertainty range) based on models with both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. One of these models has a negative present-day total ozone RF. Excluding this model, the present-day ozone RF increases to 0.39 W m−2 [0.27–0.51] (5–95\% uncertainty range). The rest of the models have RF close to or stronger than the RF time series assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the fifth assessment report with the primary driver likely being the new precursor emissions used in CMIP6. The rapid adjustments beyond stratospheric temperature are estimated to be weak and thus the RF is a good measure of effective radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based retrievals of tropospheric NO2 columns are widely used to infer NOx (≡ NO + NO2) emissions. These retrievals rely on model information for the vertical distribution of NO2. The free tropospheric background above 2 km is particularly important because the sensitivity of the retrievals increases with altitude. Free tropospheric NOx also has a strong effect on tropospheric OH and ozone concentrations. Here we use observations from three aircraft campaigns (SEAC4RS, DC3, and ATom) and four atmospheric chemistry models (GEOS-Chem, GMI, TM5, and CAMS) to evaluate the model capabilities for simulating NOx in the free troposphere and attribute it to sources. NO2 measurements during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) and Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaigns over the southeastern U.S. in summer show increasing concentrations in the upper troposphere above 10 km, which are not replicated by the GEOS-Chem, although the model is consistent with the NO measurements. Using concurrent NO, NO2, and ozone observations from a DC3 flight in a thunderstorm outflow, we show that the NO2 measurements in the upper troposphere are biased high, plausibly due to interference from thermally labile NO2 reservoirs such as peroxynitric acid (HNO4) and methyl peroxy nitrate (MPN). We find that NO2 concentrations calculated from the NO measurements and NO–NO2 photochemical steady state (PSS) are more reliable to evaluate the vertical profiles of NO2 in models. GEOS-Chem reproduces the shape of the PSS-inferred NO2 profiles throughout the troposphere for SEAC4RS and DC3 but overestimates NO2 concentrations by about a factor of 2. The model underestimates MPN and alkyl nitrate concentrations, suggesting missing organic NOx chemistry. On the other hand, the standard GEOS-Chem model underestimates NO observations from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) campaigns over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating a missing NOx source over the oceans. We find that we can account for this missing source by including in the model the photolysis of particulate nitrate on sea salt aerosols at rates inferred from laboratory studies and field observations of nitrous acid (HONO) over the Atlantic. The median PSS-inferred tropospheric NO2 column density for the ATom campaign is 1.7 ± 0.44 × 1014 molec. cm−2, and the NO2 column density simulated by the four models is in the range of 1.4–2.4 × 1014 molec. cm−2, implying that the uncertainty from using modeled NO2 tropospheric columns over clean areas in the retrievals for stratosphere–troposphere separation is about 1 × 1014 molec. cm−2. We find from GEOS-Chem that lightning is the main primary NOx source in the free troposphere over the tropics and southern midlatitudes, but aircraft emissions dominate at northern midlatitudes in winter and in summer over the oceans. Particulate nitrate photolysis increases ozone concentrations by up to 5 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) in the free troposphere in the northern extratropics in the model, which would largely correct the low model bias relative to ozonesonde observations. Global tropospheric OH concentrations increase by 19 \%. The contribution of the free tropospheric background to the tropospheric NO2 columns observed by satellites over the contiguous U.S. increases from 25 ± 11 \% in winter to 65 ± 9 \% in summer, according to the GEOS-Chem vertical profiles. This needs to be accounted for when deriving NOx emissions from satellite NO2 column measurements.},

The data assimilation simultaneously optimizes both concentrations and emissions of multiple species through ingestion of a suite of measurements (ozone, NO2, CO, HNO3) from multiple satellite sensors. In spite of substantial model differences, the observational density and accuracy was sufficient for the assimilation to reduce the multi-model spread by 20\&thinsp;\%–85\&thinsp;\% for ozone and annual mean bias by 39\&thinsp;\%–97\&thinsp;\% for ozone in the middle troposphere, while simultaneously reducing the tropospheric NO2 column biases by more than 40\&thinsp;\% and the negative biases of surface CO in the Northern Hemisphere by 41\&thinsp;\%–94\&thinsp;\%.

	abstract = {Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather, to planning renewable energy use. Here, we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ensemble forecast, ENS. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.4\% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, where critical weather-dependent decisions are made with greater accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Dry deposition of ozone is an important sink of ozone in near-surface air. When dry deposition occurs through plant stomata, ozone can injure the plant, altering water and carbon cycling and reducing crop yields. Quantifying both stomatal and nonstomatal uptake accurately is relevant for understanding ozone's impact on human health as an air pollutant and on climate as a potent short-lived greenhouse gas and primary control on the removal of several reactive greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Robust ozone dry deposition estimates require knowledge of the relative importance of individual deposition pathways, but spatiotemporal variability in nonstomatal deposition is poorly understood. Here we integrate understanding of ozone deposition processes by synthesizing research from fields such as atmospheric chemistry, ecology, and meteorology. We critically review methods for measurements and modeling, highlighting the empiricism that underpins modeling and thus the interpretation of observations. Our unprecedented synthesis of knowledge on deposition pathways, particularly soil and leaf cuticles, reveals process understanding not yet included in widely used models. If coordinated with short-term field intensives, laboratory studies, and mechanistic modeling, measurements from a few long-term sites would bridge the molecular to ecosystem scales necessary to establish the relative importance of individual deposition pathways and the extent to which they vary in space and time. Our recommended approaches seek to close knowledge gaps that currently limit quantifying the impact of ozone dry deposition on air quality, ecosystems, and climate.},

	abstract = {Severe surface ozone pollution over major Chinese cities has become an emerging air quality concern, raising a new challenge for emission control measures in China. In this study, we explore the source contributions to surface daily maximum 8\&thinsp;h average (MDA8) ozone over China in 2016 and 2017, the 2 years with the highest surface ozone averaged over Chinese cities in record. We estimate the contributions of anthropogenic, background, and individual natural sources to surface ozone over China using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25∘×0.3125∘ horizontal resolution with the most up-to-date Chinese anthropogenic emission inventory. Model results are evaluated with concurrent surface ozone measurements at 169 cities over China and show generally good agreement. We find that background ozone (defined as ozone that would be present in the absence of all Chinese anthropogenic emissions) accounts for 90\&thinsp;\% (49.4\&thinsp;ppbv) of the national March–April mean surface MDA8 ozone over China and 80\&thinsp;\% (44.5\&thinsp;ppbv) for May–August. It includes large contributions from natural sources (80\&thinsp;\% in March–April and 72\&thinsp;\% in May–August). Among them, biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions enhance MDA8 ozone by more than 15\&thinsp;ppbv in eastern China during July–August, while lightning NOx emissions and ozone transport from the stratosphere both lead to ozone enhancements of over 20\&thinsp;ppbv in western China during March–April. Over major Chinese city clusters, domestic anthropogenic sources account for about 30\&thinsp;\% of the May–August mean surface MDA8 ozone and reach 39–73\&thinsp;ppbv (38\&thinsp;\%–69\&thinsp;\%) for days with simulated MDA8 ozone \&gt; 100\&thinsp;ppbv in the North China Plain, Fenwei Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta city clusters. These high ozone episodes are usually associated with high temperatures, which induce large BVOC emissions and enhance ozone chemical production. Our results indicate that there would be no days with MDA8 ozone \&gt; 80\&thinsp;ppbv in these major Chinese cities in the absence of domestic anthropogenic emissions. We find that the 2017 ozone increases relative to 2016 are largely due to higher background ozone driven by hotter and drier weather conditions, while changes in domestic anthropogenic emissions alone would have led to ozone decreases in 2017. Meteorological conditions in 2017 favor natural source contributions (particularly soil NOx and BVOC ozone enhancements) and ozone chemical production, increase the thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and further decrease ozone dry deposition velocity. More stringent emission control measures are thus required to offset the adverse effects of unfavorable meteorology, such as high temperature, on surface ozone air quality.},

	abstract = {Observational records of meteorological and chemical variables are imprinted by an unknown combination of anthropogenic activity, natural forcings, and internal variability. With a 15-member initial-condition ensemble generated from the CESM2-WACCM6 chemistry-climate model for 1950–2014, we extract signals of anthropogenic (‘forced’) change from the noise of internally arising climate variability on observed tropospheric ozone trends. Positive trends in free tropospheric ozone measured at long-term surface observatories, by commercial aircraft, and retrieved from satellite instruments generally fall within the ensemble range. CESM2-WACCM6 tropospheric ozone trends are also bracketed by those in a larger ensemble constructed from five additional chemistry-climate models. Comparison of the multi-model ensemble with observed tropospheric column ozone trends in the northern tropics implies an underestimate in regional precursor emission growth over recent decades. Positive tropospheric ozone trends clearly emerge from 1950 to 2014, exceeding 0.2 DU yr−1 at 20–40 N in all CESM2-WACCM6 ensemble members. Tropospheric ozone observations are often only available for recent decades, and we show that even a two-decade record length is insufficient to eliminate the role of internal variability, which can produce regional tropospheric ozone trends oppositely signed from ensemble mean (forced) changes. By identifying regions and seasons with strong anthropogenic change signals relative to internal variability, initial-condition ensembles can guide future observing systems seeking to detect anthropogenic change. For example, analysis of the CESM2-WACCM6 ensemble reveals year-round upper tropospheric ozone increases from 1995 to 2014, largest at 30 S–40 N during boreal summer. Lower tropospheric ozone increases most strongly in the winter hemisphere, and internal variability leads to trends of opposite sign (ensemble overlaps zero) north of 40 N during boreal summer. This decoupling of ozone trends in the upper and lower troposphere suggests a growing prominence for tropospheric ozone as a greenhouse gas despite regional efforts to abate warm season ground-level ozone.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Despite decades of effort, the drivers of global long-term trends in tropospheric ozone are not well understood, impacting estimates of ozone radiative forcing and the global ozone budget. We analyze tropospheric ozone trends since 1980 using ozonesondes and remote surface measurements around the globe and investigate the ability of two atmospheric chemical transport models, GEOS-Chem and MERRA2-GMI, to reproduce these trends. Global tropospheric ozone trends measured at 25 ozonesonde sites from 1990–2017 (9 sites since 1980s) show increasing trends averaging 2.1 ± 1.3 ppb decade-1 across sites in the free troposphere (800–400 hPa). Relative trends in sondes are more pronounced closer to the surface (5.1 \% decade-1 above 700 hPa, 4.0 \% decade-1 below 700 hPa on average), suggesting the importance of emissions in observed changes. While most surface sites (148 of 238) in the United States and Europe exhibit decreases in high daytime ozone values due to regulatory efforts, 73 \% of global sites outside those regions (24 of 33 sites) show increases from 1990–2014 that average 1.4 ± 0.9 ppb decade-1. In all regions, increasing ozone trends both at the surface and aloft are at least partially attributable to increases in 5th percentile ozone, which average 1.7 ± 1.0 ppb decade-1 and reflect the global increase of background ozone. Observed ozone percentile distributions at the surface have shifted notably across the globe: all regions show increases in low tails (i.e., below 25th percentile), North America and Europe show decreases in high tails (above 75th percentile), and the Southern Hemisphere and Japan show increases across the entire distribution. Three model simulations comprising different emissions inventories, chemical schemes, and resolutions, sampled at the same locations and times of observations, are not able to replicate long-term ozone trends either at the surface or free troposphere, often underestimating trends. We find that {\textasciitilde}60 \% of the average ozone trend from 800–400 hPa across the 25 ozonesonde sites is captured by MERRA2-GMI and {\textless}15 \% is captured by GEOS-Chem. MERRA2-GMI performs better than GEOS-Chem in the northern mid-latitude free troposphere, reproducing 71 \% of increasing trends since 1990 and capturing stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) determined via a stratospheric ozone tracer. While all models tend to capture the direction of shifts in the ozone distribution and typically capture changes in high and low tails, they tend to underestimate the magnitude of the shift in medians. However, each model shows an 8–12 \% (or 23–32 Tg) increase in total tropospheric ozone burden from 1980 to 2017. Sensitivity simulations using GEOS-Chem and the stratospheric ozone tracer in MERRA2-GMI suggest that in the northern mid- and high latitudes, dynamics such as STE are most important for reproducing ozone trends in models in the middle and upper troposphere, while emissions are more important closer to the surface. Our model evaluation for the last 4 decades reveals that the recent version of the GEOS-Chem model underpredicts free tropospheric ozone across this long time period, particularly in winter and spring over mid-to high latitudes. Such widespread model underestimation of tropospheric ozone highlights the need for better understanding of the processes that transport ozone and promote its production.},

Models facilitate the interpretation of the observations and allow us to make projections of future tropospheric ozone and trace gas distributions for different anthropogenic or natural perturbations. This paper assesses the skill of current-generation global atmospheric chemistry models in simulating the observed present-day tropospheric ozone distribution, variability, and trends. Drawing upon the results of recent international multi-model intercomparisons and using a range of model evaluation techniques, we demonstrate that global chemistry models are broadly skillful in capturing the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric ozone over the seasonal cycle, for extreme pollution episodes, and changes over interannual to decadal periods. However, models are consistently biased high in the northern hemisphere and biased low in the southern hemisphere, throughout the depth of the troposphere, and are unable to replicate particular metrics that define the longer term trends in tropospheric ozone as derived from some background sites. When the models compare unfavorably against observations, we discuss the potential causes of model biases and propose directions for future developments, including improved evaluations that may be able to better diagnose the root cause of the model-observation disparity. Overall, model results should be approached critically, including determining whether the model performance is acceptable for the problem being addressed, whether biases can be tolerated or corrected, whether the model is appropriately constituted, and whether there is a way to satisfactorily quantify the uncertainty.},

We simulated a 15 year period (1979–1993) on the basis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts meteorological reanalyses and a time-varying emission data set. We calculate that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) strongly contributes to O3 in regions where the photochemistry is quiescent. Since such regions play a minor role in radiative and chemical processes, we argue that STE-derived O3 is much less important than is suggested by its column abundance. By distinguishing between photochemical pathways in the model we calculate that tropospheric O3 in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is strongly affected by industrial and fossil fuel-related emissions. In the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, natural emissions still play a major role. Our model results indicate a less important role for man-made biomass burning emissions than previous analyses. Further, the results show that tropospheric O3 trends are strongly influenced by transports of pollution and by meteorological variability. Scenario calculations for the year 2025 suggest that man-made emissions at low northern latitudes, in particular in southern and eastern Asia, will become a very strong tropospheric O3 source in the next decades. This will influence O3 levels on a hemispheric scale so that despite pollution regulations in Europe and North America, surface O3 will continue to grow.},

We develop a novel data-driven ensembling strategy for combining geophysical models using Bayesian Neural Networks, which infers spatiotemporally varying model weights and bias while accounting for heteroscedastic uncertainties in the observations. This produces more accurate and uncertainty-aware projections without sacrificing interpretability. Applied to the prediction of total column ozone from an ensemble of 15 chemistry-climate models, we find that the Bayesian neural network ensemble (BayNNE) outperforms existing ensembling methods, achieving a 49.4\% reduction in RMSE for temporal extrapolation, and a 67.4\% reduction in RMSE for polar data voids, compared to a weighted mean. Uncertainty is also well-characterized, with 90.6\% of the data points in our extrapolation validation dataset lying within 2 standard deviations and 98.5\% within 3 standard deviations.},

	abstract = {Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) in the United States have declined significantly during the past three decades. However, satellite observations since 2009 indicate total column NO2 is no longer declining even as bottom-up inventories suggest continued decline in emissions. Multiple explanations have been proposed for this discrepancy including (a) the increasing relative importance of nonurban NOx to total column NO2, (b) differences between background and urban NOx lifetimes, and (c) that the actual NOx emissions are declining more slowly after 2009. Here, we use a deep learning model trained by NOx emissions and surface observations of ozone to assess consistency between the reported NOx trends between 2005 and 2014 and observations of surface ozone. We find that the satellite-derived trends best reproduce ozone in low NOx emission (background) regions. The 2010–2014 trend from older satellite-derived emission estimates produced at low spatial resolution results in the largest bias in surface ozone in regions with high NOx emissions, reflecting the blending of urban and background NOx in these low-resolution top-down analyses. In contrast, the trend from higher resolution satellite-based estimates, which are more capable of capturing the urban emission signature, is in better agreement with ozone in high NOx emission regions, and is consistent with the trend based on surface observations of NO2. Our results confirm that the satellite-derived trends reflect anthropogenic and background influences.},

	abstract = {Current AutoML systems have been benchmarked with traditional natural image datasets. Differences between satellite images and natural images (e.g., bit-wise resolution, the number, and type of spectral bands) and lack of labeled satellite images for training models, pose open questions about the applicability of current AutoML systems on satellite data. In this paper, we demonstrate how AutoML can be leveraged for classification tasks on satellite data. Specifically, we deploy the Auto-Keras system for image classification tasks and create two new variants, IMG-AK and RS-AK, for satellite image classification that respectively incorporate transfer learning using models pre-trained with (i) natural images (using ImageNet) and (ii) remote sensing datasets. For evaluation, we compared the performance of these variants against manually designed architectures on a benchmark set of 7 satellite datasets. Our results show that in 71\% of the cases the AutoML systems outperformed the best previously proposed model, highlighting the usefulness of a customized satellite data search space in AutoML systems. Our RS-AK variant performed better than IMG-AK for small datasets with a limited amount of training data. Furthermore, it found the best automated model for the datasets composed of near-infrared, green, and red bands.},

The BigEarthNet consists of 590, 326 Sentinel-2 image patches, each of which is a section of i) 120 × 120 pixels for 10m bands; ii) 60×60 pixels for 20m bands; and iii) 20×20 pixels for 60m bands. Unlike most of the existing archives, each image patch is annotated by multiple land-cover classes (i.e., multi-labels) that are provided from the CORINE Land Cover database of the year 2018 (CLC 2018). The BigEarthNet is significantly larger than the existing archives in remote sensing (RS) and thus is much more convenient to be used as a training source in the context of deep learning. This paper first addresses the limitations of the existing archives and then describes the properties of the BigEarthNet. Experimental results obtained in the framework of RS image scene classification problems show that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on the BigEarthNet provides much higher accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet (which is a very popular large-scale benchmark archive in computer vision). The BigEarthNet opens up promising directions to advance operational RS applications and research in massive Sentinel-2 image archives.},

	abstract = {We review model simulations from the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative to assess the changes in the tropospheric ozone burden and its budget from 1850 to 2010. Analysis of these data indicates that there has been significant growth in the ozone burden from 1850 to 2000 (approximately 43 + 9\%) but smaller growth between 1960 and 2000 (approximately 16 + 10\%) and that the models simulate burdens of ozone well within recent satellite estimates. The Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative model ozone budgets indicate that the net chemical production of ozone in the troposphere plateaued in the 1990s and has not changed since then inspite of increases in the burden. There has been a shift in net ozone production in the troposphere being greatest in the northern mid and high latitudes to the northern tropics, driven by the regional evolution of precursor emissions. An analysis of the evolution of tropospheric ozone through the 21st century, as simulated by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, reveals a large source of uncertainty associated with models themselves (i.e., in the way that they simulate the chemical and physical processes that control tropospheric ozone). This structural uncertainty is greatest in the near term (two to three decades), but emissions scenarios dominate uncertainty in the longer term (2050–2100) evolution of tropospheric ozone. This intrinsic model uncertainty prevents robust predictions of near-term changes in the tropospheric ozone burden, and we review how progress can be made to reduce this limitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone–climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric scales. New observational opportunities are offered both by satellites and small sensors that bridge the scales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relative risk estimates for long-term ozone (O3) exposure and respiratory mortality from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (ACS CPS-II) cohort have been used to estimate global O3-attributable mortality in adults. Updated relative risk estimates are now available for the same cohort based on an expanded study population with longer follow-up.
OBJECTIVES: We estimated the global burden and spatial distribution of respiratory mortality attributable to long-term O3 exposure in adults ≥30 y of age using updated eﬀect estimates from the ACS CPS-II cohort.
METHODS: We used GEOS-Chem simulations (2 × 2:5  grid resolution) to estimate annual O3 exposures, and estimated total respiratory deaths in 2010 that were attributable to long-term annual O3 exposure based on the updated relative risk estimates and minimum risk thresholds set at the minimum or ﬁfth percentile of O3 exposure in the most recent CPS-II analysis. These estimates were compared with attributable mortality based on the earlier CPS-II analysis, using 6-mo average exposures and risk thresholds corresponding to the minimum or ﬁfth percentile of O3 exposure in the earlier study population.
RESULTS: We estimated 1.04–1.23 million respiratory deaths in adults attributable to O3 exposures using the updated relative risk estimate and exposure parameters, compared with 0.40–0.55 million respiratory deaths attributable to O3 exposures based on the earlier CPS-II risk estimate and parameters. Increases in estimated attributable mortality were larger in northern India, southeast China, and Pakistan than in Europe, eastern United States, and northeast China.
CONCLUSIONS: These ﬁndings suggest that the potential magnitude of health beneﬁts of air quality policies targeting O3, health co-beneﬁts of climate mitigation policies, and health implications of climate change-driven changes in O3 concentrations, are larger than previously thought. https://doi.org/ 10.1289/EHP1390},

The interpolated ozone concentration fields were constructed using 15 building sites whose daily trends were predicted by random forest regression. Spatially interpolated ozone concentrations were evaluated at 12 sites that were independent from the machine learning sites and historical data to find the most suitable prediction method for SoCAB. Ordinary kriging interpolation had the best performance overall for 2020. The model is best at interpolating ozone concentrations inside the sampling region (bounded by the building sites), with R2 ranging from 0.56 to 0.85 for those sites. All interpolation methods poorly predicted and underestimated ozone concentrations for Crestline during summer, indicating that the site has a distribution of ozone concentrations that is independent from all other sites. Therefore, historical data from coastal and inland sites should not be used to predict ozone in Crestline using data-driven spatial interpolation approaches. The study demonstrates the utility of ML and geospatial techniques for evaluating air pollution levels during anomalous periods. Both ML and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model do not fully capture the irregularities caused by emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdown period (March–May) in the SoCAB. Including 2020 training data in the ML model training improves the model's performance and its potential to predict future abnormalities in air quality.},

To support the Global Burden of Disease Study, we produce yearly fine resolution global surface ozone estimates from 1990 to 2017 through a data fusion of observations and models. As ozone observations are sparse in many populated regions, we use a novel combination of the M3Fusion and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) methods. With M3Fusion, we create a multimodel composite by bias-correcting and weighting nine global atmospheric chemistry models based on their ability to predict observations (8834 sites globally) in each region and year. BME is then used to integrate observations, such that estimates match observations at each monitoring site with the observational influence decreasing smoothly across space and time until the output matches the multimodel composite. After estimating at 0.5° resolution using BME, we add fine spatial detail from an additional model, yielding estimates at 0.1° resolution. Observed ozone is predicted more accurately (R2 = 0.81 at the test point, 0.63 at 0.1°, and 0.62 at 0.5°) than the multimodel mean (R2 = 0.28 at 0.5°). Global ozone exposure is estimated to be increasing, driven by highly populated regions of Asia and Africa, despite decreases in the United States and Russia.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic.

	abstract = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary daytime oxidant in the troposphere and provides the main loss mechanism for many pollutants and greenhouse gases, including methane (CH4). Global mean tropospheric OH differs by as much as 80\% among various global models, for reasons that are not well understood. We use neural networks (NNs), trained using archived output from eight chemical transport models (CTMs) that participated in the Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols and Transport Model Intercomparison Project (POLMIP), to quantify the factors responsible for differences in tropospheric OH and resulting CH4 lifetime (τCH4) between these models. Annual average τCH4, for loss by OH only, ranges from 8.0 to 11.6 years for the eight POLMIP CTMs. The factors driving these differences were quantiﬁed by inputting 3-D chemical ﬁelds from one CTM into the trained NN of another CTM. Across all CTMs, the largest mean differences in τCH4 (ΔτCH4) result from variations in chemical mechanisms (ΔτCH4 = 0.46 years), the photolysis frequency (J) of O3 → O(1D) (0.31 years), local O3 (0.30 years), and CO (0.23 years). The ΔτCH4 due to CTM differences in NOx (NO + NO2) is relatively low (0.17 years), although large regional variation in OH between the CTMs is attributed to NOx. Differences in isoprene and J(NO2) have negligible overall effect on globally averaged tropospheric OH, although the extent of OH variations due to each factor depends on the model being examined. This study demonstrates that NNs can serve as a useful tool for quantifying why tropospheric OH varies between global models, provided that essential chemical ﬁelds are archived.},

	abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backward optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

Forecasting models are limited by computational costs and therefore often can only make coarse resolution predictions. Statistical downscaling can provide an efficient method of upsampling low-resolution data. In this field, deep learning has been applied successfully, often using image super-resolution methods from computer vision. Despite achieving visually compelling results in some cases, such models often violate conservation laws when predicting physical variables. In order to conserve important physical quantities, we develop methods that guarantee physical constraints are satisfied by a deep downscaling model while also increasing their performance according to traditional metrics. We introduce two ways of constraining the network: A renormalization layer added to the end of the neural network and a successive approach that scales with increasing upsampling factors. We show the applicability of our methods across different popular architectures and upsampling factors using ERA5 reanalysis data.},

	abstract = {The prediction of tropospheric ozone concentrations is vital due to ozone’s passive impacts on atmosphere, people’s health, flora and fauna. However, ozone prediction is a complex process and the wide range of traditional models is incapable to obtain an accurate prediction. “Artificial intelligence”, “machine learning” and “ozone prediction model” search terms in the title, abstract or keywords are involved. Inclusion criteria include subject area (engineering, computer science), English language and being published from 2015. This criterion obtained 156 articles, which were categorized into 4 areas of interest based on the machine learning technique applied. Recently as a result of the rapid development in the technology and the increase in the number of measured data, artificial intelligence techniques have been intensively used in predicting ozone concentration as an alternative to the traditional models. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the most developed techniques that have been used in predicting ozone concentrations as well as theoretic approaches such as information set approaches, fuzzy set approach and probabilistic set approaches. It is clearly stated that the standalone algorithms such as decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed multilayer perceptron (MLP); however, the latter is massively implemented by many researchers in the prediction of ozone concentrations. This review paper investigated artificial intelligence techniques integrated with optimization approaches. It can be concluded that hybrid algorithms have significantly improved the prediction accuracy. However, the majority of the proposed hybrid models have limitations; thus, there is a need to develop better hybrid algorithm that is able to tackle all the drawbacks of the improved algorithms and capable to capture the ozone concentration changes with a high level of accuracy.},

Here we present a data-driven ozone mapping workflow generating a transparent and reliable product. We map the global distribution of tropospheric ozone from sparse, irregularly placed measurement stations to a high-resolution regular grid using machine learning methods. The produced map contains the average tropospheric ozone concentration of the years 2010\&ndash;2014 with a resolution of 0.1\&deg; \&times; 0.1\&deg;. The machine learning model is trained on AQ-Bench, a precompiled benchmark dataset consisting of multi-year ground-based ozone measurements combined with an abundance of high-resolution geospatial data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Going beyond standard mapping methods, this work focuses on two key aspects to increase the integrity of the produced map. Using explainable machine learning methods we ensure that the trained machine learning model is consistent with commonly accepted knowledge about tropospheric ozone. To assess the impact of data and model uncertainties on our ozone map, we show that the machine learning model is robust against typical fluctuations in ozone values and geospatial data. By inspecting the feature space, we ensure that the model is only applied in regions where it is reliable.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We provide a rationale for the tools we use to conduct a thorough global analysis.

	abstract = {Heat waves and air pollution episodes pose a serious threat to human health and may worsen under future climate change. In this paper, we use 15 years (1999–2013) of commensurately gridded (1° x 1°) surface observations of extended summer (April–September) surface ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and maximum temperature (TX) over the eastern United States and Canada to construct a climatology of the coincidence, overlap, and lag in space and time of their extremes. Extremes of each quantity are defined climatologically at each grid cell as the 50 d with the highest values in three 5-y windows (∼95th percentile). Any two extremes occur on the same day in the same grid cell more than 50\% of the time in the northeastern United States, but on a domain average, co-occurrence is approximately 30\%. Although not exactly co-occurring, many of these extremes show connectedness with consistent offsets in space and in time, which often defy traditional mechanistic explanations. All three extremes occur primarily in large-scale, multiday, spatially connected episodes with scales of {\textgreater}1,000 km and clearly coincide with large-scale meteorological features. The largest, longest-lived episodes have the highest incidence of co-occurrence and contain extreme values well above their local 95th percentile threshold, by +7 ppb for O3, +6 µg m−3 for PM2.5, and +1.7 °C for TX. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate these extremes as synergistic costressors to accurately quantify their impacts on human health.},

	abstract = {Issues regarding air quality and related health concerns have prompted this study, which develops an accurate and computationally fast, efficient hybrid modeling system that combines numerical modeling and machine learning for forecasting concentrations of surface ozone. Currently available numerical modeling systems for air quality predictions (e.g., CMAQ) can forecast 24 to 48 h in advance. In this study, we develop a modeling system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is not only fast but covers a temporal period of two weeks with a resolution as small as a single hour for 255 stations. The CNN model uses meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (processed by the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor), forecasted air quality from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), and previous 24-h concentrations of various measurable air quality parameters as inputs and predicts the following 14-day hourly surface ozone concentrations. The model achieves an average accuracy of 0.91 in terms of the index of agreement for the first day and 0.78 for the fourteenth day, while the average index of agreement for one day ahead prediction from the CMAQ is 0.77. Through this study, we intend to amalgamate the best features of numerical modeling (i.e., fine spatial resolution) and a deep neural network (i.e., computation speed and accuracy) to achieve more accurate spatio-temporal predictions of hourly ozone concentrations. Although the primary purpose of this study is the prediction of hourly ozone concentrations, the system can be extended to various other pollutants.},

	abstract = {The ability to forecast the concentration of air pollutants in an urban region is crucial for decision-makers wishing to reduce the impact of pollution on public health through active measures (e.g. temporary traffic closures). In this study, we present a machine learning approach applied to forecasts of the day-ahead maximum value of ozone concentration for several geographical locations in southern Switzerland. Due to the low density of measurement stations and to the complex orography of the use-case terrain, we adopted feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features to a neighborhood of the prediction sites, as common in spatio-temporal forecasting methods. We then used Shapley values to assess the explainability of the learned models in terms of feature importance and feature interactions in relation to ozone predictions. Our analysis suggests that the trained models effectively learned explanatory cross-dependencies among atmospheric variables. Finally, we show how weighting observations helps to increase the accuracy of the forecasts for specific ranges of ozone’s daily peak values.},
