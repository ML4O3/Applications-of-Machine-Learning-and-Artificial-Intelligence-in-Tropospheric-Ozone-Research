	abstract = {In numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, physical parameterization schemes are the most computationally expensive components, despite being greatly simplified. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that machine learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid physics have the potential to accelerate and even outperform conventional physics-based schemes. However, as the ML models are commonly implemented using the ML libraries written in Python, very few ML-based parameterizations have been successfully integrated with NWP models due to the difficulty of embedding Python functions into Fortran-based NWP models. To address this issue, we developed a coupler to allow the ML-based parameterizations to be coupled with a widely used NWP model, i.e., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Similar to the WRF I/O methodologies, the coupler provides the options to run the ML model inference with exclusive processors or the same processors for WRF calculations. In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the coupler, the ML-based radiation emulators are trained and coupled with the WRF model successfully.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and deep learning methods have been widely explored in understanding the chaotic behavior of the atmosphere and furthering weather forecasting. There has been increasing interest from technology companies, government institutions, and meteorological agencies in building digital twins of the Earth. Recent approaches using transformers, physics-informed machine learning, and graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on relatively narrow spatiotemporal scales and specific tasks. With the recent success of generative artificial intelligence (AI) using pre-trained transformers for language modeling and vision with prompt engineering and fine-tuning, we are now moving towards generalizable AI. In particular, we are witnessing the rise of AI foundation models that can perform competitively on multiple domain-specific downstream tasks. Despite this progress, we are still in the nascent stages of a generalizable AI model for global Earth system models, regional climate models, and mesoscale weather models. Here, we review current state-of-the-art AI approaches, primarily from transformer and operator learning literature in the context of meteorology. We provide our perspective on criteria for success towards a family of foundation models for nowcasting and forecasting weather and climate predictions. We also discuss how such models can perform competitively on downstream tasks such as downscaling (super-resolution), identifying conditions conducive to the occurrence of wildfires, and predicting consequential meteorological phenomena across various spatiotemporal scales such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers. In particular, we examine current AI methodologies and contend they have matured enough to design and implement a weather foundation model.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development of U-net++ models, a type of neural network that performs deep learning, to emulate the shortwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM). The goal is to emulate the RRTM accurately in a small fraction of the computing time, creating a U-net++ that could be used as a parameterization in numerical weather prediction (NWP). Target variables are surface downwelling flux, top-of-atmosphere upwelling flux ( FupTOA), net flux, and a profile of radiative-heating rates. We have devised several ways to make the U-net++ models knowledge-guided, recently identified as a key priority in machine learning (ML) applications to the geosciences. We conduct two experiments to find the best U-net++ configurations. In experiment 1, we train on nontropical sites and test on tropical sites, to assess extreme spatial generalization. In experiment 2, we train on sites from all regions and test on different sites from all regions, with the goal of creating the best possible model for use in NWP. The selected model from experiment 1 shows impressive skill on the tropical testing sites, except four notable deficiencies: large bias and error for heating rate in the upper stratosphere, unreliable FupTOA for profiles with single-layer liquid cloud, large heating-rate bias in the midtroposphere for profiles with multilayer liquid cloud, and negative bias at low zenith angles for all flux components and tropospheric heating rates. The selected model from experiment 2 corrects all but the first deficiency, and both models run {\textasciitilde}104 times faster than the RRTM. Our code is available publicly.},

	abstract = {A major computational barrier in global modeling of atmospheric chemistry is the numerical integration of the coupled kinetic equations describing the chemical mechanism. Machine-learned (ML) solvers can offer order of magnitude speedup relative to conventional implicit solvers but past implementations have suffered from fast error growth and only run for short simulation times ({\textless}1 month). A successful ML solver for global models must avoid error growth over yearlong simulations and allow for reinitialization of the chemical trajectory by transport at every time step. Here, we explore the capability of a neural network solver equipped with an autoencoder to achieve stable full-year simulations of tropospheric oxidant chemistry in the global 3-D Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem model, replacing its standard mechanism (228 species) by the Super-Fast mechanism (12 species) to avoid the curse of dimensionality. We find that online training of the ML solver within GEOS-Chem is important for accuracy, whereas offline training from archived GEOS-Chem inputs/outputs produces large errors. After online training, we achieve stable 1-year simulations with five-fold speedup compared to the standard implicit Rosenbrock solver with global tropospheric normalized mean biases of −0.3\% for ozone, 1\% for hydrogen oxide radicals, and −5\% for nitrogen oxides. The ML solver captures the diurnal and synoptic variability of surface ozone at polluted and clean sites. There are however large regional biases for ozone and NOx under remote conditions where chemical aging leads to error accumulation. These regional biases remain a major limitation for practical application, and ML emulation would be more difficult in a more complex mechanism.},

	abstract = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary cleansing agent in the atmosphere. The abundance of OH in cities initiates the removal of local pollutants; therefore, it serves as the key species describing the urban chemical environment. We propose a machine learning (ML) approach as an efficient alternative to OH simulation using a computationally expensive chemical transport model. The ML model is trained on the parameters simulated from the WRF-Chem model, and it suggests that six predictive parameters are capable of explaining 76\% of the OH variability. The parameters are the tropospheric NO2 column, the tropospheric HCHO column, J(O1D), H2O, temperature, and pressure. We then use observations of the tropospheric NO2 column and HCHO column from OMI as input to the ML model to enable measurement-based prediction of daily near surface OH at 1:30 pm local time across 49 North American cities over the course of 10 years between 2005 and 2014. The result is validated by comparing the OH predictions to measurements of isoprene, which has a source that is uncorrelated with OH and is removed rapidly and almost exclusively by OH in the daytime. We demonstrate that the predicted OH is, as expected, anticorrelated with isoprene. We also show that this ML model is consistent with our understanding of OH chemistry given the solely data-driven nature.},

The feature importance results show that cloud optical depth (COD), relative humidity, and precipitation are the top three factors affecting CTM high biases. Such results indicate that the high ozone biases in summer over China mainly occur on wet/cloudy days (∼40\% biased high), while biases on dry/clear days are small (within 5\%). We link the important features with model parameterizations and variables, identifying model underestimates in the dry deposition velocity and COD on wet/cloudy days. By accounting for the enhanced dry deposition on wet plant cuticles and using satellite observation constrained COD, we find that CTM high ozone biases can be halved with an improved agreement in the temporal variability, highlighting the effects of dry deposition and COD on ozone, as suggested by the RF outcomes.},

	abstract = {Modeling atmospheric chemistry is computationally expensive and limits the widespread use of atmospheric chemical transport models. This computational cost arises from solving high-dimensional systems of stiff differential equations. Previous work has demonstrated the promise of machine learning (ML) to accelerate air quality model simulations but has suffered from numerical instability during long-term simulations. This may be because previous ML-based efforts have relied on explicit Euler time integration – which is known to be unstable for stiff systems – and have used neural networks which are prone to overfitting. We hypothesize that the creation of parsimonious models combined with modern numerical integration techniques can overcome this limitation. Using a small-scale photochemical mechanism to explore the potential of these methods, we have created a machine-learned surrogate by (1) reducing dimensionality using singular value decomposition to create an interpretably-compressed low-dimensional latent space, and (2) using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to create a differential-equation-based representation of the underlying chemical dynamics in the compressed latent space with reduced numerical stiffness. The root mean square error of the ML model prediction for ozone concentration over nine days is 37.8\% of the root mean concentration across all simulations in our testing dataset. The surrogate model is 11\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster with 12\${\textbackslash}times\$ fewer integration timesteps compared to the reference model and is numerically stable in all tested simulations. Overall, we find that SINDy can be used to create fast, stable, and accurate surrogates of a simple photochemical mechanism. In future work, we will explore the application of this method to more detailed mechanisms and their use in large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {Ozone (O3) is one of the common air pollutants. An increase in the ozone concentration can adversely affect public health and the environment such as vegetation and crops. Therefore, atmospheric air quality monitoring systems were found to monitor and predict ozone concentration. Due to complex formation of ozone influenced by precursors of ozone (O3) and meteorological conditions, there is a need to examine and evaluate various machine learning (ML) models for ozone concentration prediction. This study aims to utilize various ML models including Linear Regression (LR), Tree Regression (TR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Ensemble Regression (ER), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Artificial Neural Networks Models (ANN) to predict tropospheric (O3) using ozone concentration dataset. The dataset was created by observing hourly average data from air quality monitoring systems in 3 different stations including Putrajaya, Kelang, and KL in 3 sites in Peninsular Malaysia. The prediction models have been trained on this dataset and validated by optimizing their hyperparameters. Additionally, the performance of models was evaluated in terms of RMSE, MAE, R2, and training time. The results indicated that LR, SVR, GPR and ANN were able to give the highest R2 (83 \% and 89 \%) with specific hyperparameters in stations Kelang and KL, respectively. On the other hand, SVR and ER outweigh other models in terms of R2 (79 \%) in Putrajaya station. Overall, regardless slightly performance differences, several developed models were able to learn patterns well and provide good prediction performance in terms of R2, RMSE and MAE. Ensemble regression models were found to balance between high prediction accuracy in terms of R2 and low training time and thus considered as a feasible solution for application of Ozone concentration prediction using the data in hourly scenario.},

	abstract = {Explicit gas-phase chemical mechanisms represent the state of knowledge regarding the chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are crucial in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). However, these chemical mechanisms are computationally expensive, which limits their practical use in large-scale air quality modeling. Mechanism reduction is therefore required for computational efficiency while preserving the accuracy of the detailed gas-phase chemical mechanisms. This paper presents a new version of the Generator of Reduced Organic Aerosol Mechanisms (GENOA v2.0), which reduces mechanisms at a size suitable for three-dimensional (3-D) modeling while preserving the accuracy of detailed chemical mechanisms for simulating aerosol concentrations. GENOA v2.0 adopts a parallel reduction framework to identify the most optimal reductions from competitive candidates, and can reduce chemical mechanisms from multiple aerosol precursors. To demonstrate the reduction efficiency, GENOA v2.0 is applied to the reduction of monoterpene chemistry from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) combined with the Peroxy Radical Autoxidation Mechanism (PRAM) mechanism. The original mechanism, consisting of 3 001 reactions and 1 227 species (including 738 condensable species), is reduced by 93\% to 197 reactions and 110 species (including 23 condensable species), inducing an average error of only 3\% in aerosol concentrations. Sensitivity tests showed that this reduced mechanism behaved similarly to the original mechanism in response to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, and SOA mass loading. Moreover, if the error tolerance is increased to 20\% — which can still be acceptable for 3-D air quality modeling — the mechanism can be further simplified to 40 reactions and 24 species (including 5 condensable species). Consequently, the GENOA-generated aerosol mechanism preserves the complexity of the detailed gas-phase chemical mechanisms on SOA formation while increasing computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for most environmental conditions encountered in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Gas-phase oxidation of isoprene by ozone (O3) and the hydroxyl (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals significantly impacts tropospheric oxidant levels and secondary organic aerosol formation. The most comprehensive and up-to-date chemical mechanism for isoprene oxidation consists of several hundred species and over 800 reactions. Therefore, the computational expense of including the entire mechanism in large-scale atmospheric chemical transport models is usually prohibitive, and most models employ reduced isoprene mechanisms ranging in size from ∼ 10 to ∼ 200 species. We have developed a new reduced isoprene oxidation mechanism using a directed-graph path-based automated model reduction approach, with minimal manual adjustment of the output mechanism. The approach takes as inputs a full isoprene oxidation mechanism, the environmental parameter space, and a list of priority species which are protected from elimination during the reduction process. Our reduced mechanism, AMORE-Isoprene (where AMORE stands for Automated Model Reduction), consists of 12 species which are unique to the isoprene mechanism as well as 22 reactions. We demonstrate its performance in a box model in comparison with experimental data from the literature and other current isoprene oxidation mechanisms. AMORE-Isoprene's performance with respect to predicting the time evolution of isoprene oxidation products, including isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) and formaldehyde, is favorable compared with other similarly sized mechanisms. When AMORE-Isoprene is included in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism 1.0 (CRACMM1AMORE) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ, v5.3.3), O3 and formaldehyde agreement with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System observations is improved. O3 bias is reduced by 3.4 ppb under daytime conditions for O3 concentrations over 50 ppb. Formaldehyde bias is reduced by 0.26 ppb on average for all formaldehyde measurements compared with the base CRACMM1. There was no significant change in computation time between CRACMM1AMORE and the base CRACMM. AMORE-Isoprene shows a 35 \% improvement in agreement between simulated IEPOX concentrations and chamber data over the base CRACMM1 mechanism when compared in the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM) box model framework. This work demonstrates a new highly reduced isoprene mechanism and shows the potential value of automated model reduction for complex reaction systems.},

To accurately represent atmospheric phenomena, these models consume vast quantities of computational resources. Machine learning (ML) techniques such as neural networks have the potential to emulate computationally intensive components of these models to reduce their computational burden. However, such ML surrogate models may lead to nonphysical predictions that are difficult to uncover. Here we present a neural network architecture that enforces conservation laws to numerical precision. Instead of simply predicting properties of interest, a physically interpretable hidden layer within the network predicts fluxes between properties which are subsequently related to the properties of interest. This approach is readily generalizable to physical processes where flux continuity is an essential governing equation. As an example application, we demonstrate our approach on a neural network surrogate model of photochemistry, trained to emulate a reference model that simulates formation and reaction of ozone. We design a physics-constrained neural network surrogate model of photochemistry using this approach and find that it conserves atoms as they flow between molecules while outperforming two other neural network architectures in terms of accuracy, physical consistency, and non-negativity of concentrations.},

	abstract = {The chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS uses a volatility basis set (VBS) approach to represent the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere. Inclusion of the VBS approximately doubles the dimensionality of LOTOS-EUROS and slows computation of the advection operator by a factor of two. This complexity limits SOA representation in operational forecasts. We develop a mass-conserving dimensionality reduction method based on matrix factorization to find latent patterns in the VBS tracers that correspond to a smaller set of superspecies. Tracers are reversibly compressed to superspecies before transport, and the superspecies are subsequently decompressed to tracers for process-based SOA modeling. This physically interpretable data-driven method conserves the total concentration and phase of the tracers throughout the process. The superspecies approach is implemented in LOTOS-EUROS and found to accelerate the advection operator by a factor of 1.5–1.8. Concentrations remain numerically stable over model simulation times of 2 weeks, including simulations at higher spatial resolutions than the data-driven models were trained on. The reversible compression of VBS tracers enables detailed, process-based SOA representation in LOTOS-EUROS operational forecasts in a computationally efficient manner. Beyond this case study, the physically consistent data-driven approach developed in this work enforces conservation laws that are essential to other Earth system modeling applications, and generalizes to other processes where computational benefit can be gained from a two-way mapping between detailed process variables and their representation in a reduced-dimensional space.},

	abstract = {Explainability of AI models is an important topic that can have a significant impact in all domains and applications from autonomous driving to healthcare. The existing approaches to explainable AI (XAI) are mainly limited to simple machine learning algorithms, and the research regarding the explainability-accuracy tradeoff is still in its infancy especially when we are concerned about complex machine learning techniques like neural networks and deep learning (DL). In this work, we introduce a new approach for complex models based on the co-relation impact which enhances the explainability considerably while also ensuring the accuracy at a high level. We propose approaches for both scenarios of independent features and dependent features. In addition, we study the uncertainty associated with features and output. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound of the computation complexity of our proposed approach for the dependent features. The complexity bound depends on the order of logarithmic of the number of observations which provides a reliable result considering the higher dimension of dependent feature space with a smaller number of observations.},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed from oxidation of hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources. Accurate predictions of this chemistry are key for air quality and climate studies due to the large contribution of organic aerosols to submicron aerosol mass. Currently, only explicit models, such as the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A), can fully represent the chemical processing of thousands of organic species. However, their extreme computational cost prohibits their use in current chemistry-climate models, which rely on simplified empirical parameterizations to predict SOA concentrations. This study demonstrates that machine learning can accurately emulate SOA formation from an explicit chemistry model with an approximate error of 2\%–8\%, up to five days for several precursors and for potentially up to one month for recurrent neural network models, and with 100 to 100,000 times speedup over GECKO-A, making it computationally useable in a chemistry-climate model. We generated the training data using thousands of GECKO-A box simulations sampled from a broad range of initial environmental conditions, and focused on three representative SOA precursors: the oxidation by OH of two anthropogenic (toluene, dodecane), and the oxidation by O3 of one biogenic VOC (α-pinene). We compare several neural models and quantify their underlying uncertainty and robustness. These are promising results, suggesting that neural network models could be applied to predict SOA in chemistry-climate models, limited however to the range of environmental conditions that were considered in the training datasets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11035},
	abstract = {We developed and applied a machine-learned discretization for one-dimensional (1-D) horizontal passive scalar advection, which is an operator component common to all chemical transport models (CTMs). Our learned advection scheme resembles a second-order accuracy, three-stencil numerical solver, but differs from a traditional solver in that coefficients for each equation term are output by a neural network rather than being theoretically-derived constants. We downsampled higher-resolution simulation results – resulting in up to 16\${\textbackslash}times\$ larger grid size and 64\${\textbackslash}times\$ larger timestep – and trained our neural network-based scheme to match the downsampled integration data. In this way, we created an operator that is low-resolution (in time or space) but can reproduce the behavior of a high-resolution traditional solver. Our model shows high fidelity in reproducing its training dataset (a single 10-day 1-D simulation) and is similarly accurate in simulations with unseen initial conditions, wind fields, and grid spacing. In many cases, our learned solver is more accurate than a low-resolution version of the reference solver, but the low-resolution reference solver achieves greater computational speedup (500\${\textbackslash}times\$ acceleration) over the high-resolution simulation than the learned solver is able to (18\${\textbackslash}times\$ acceleration). Surprisingly, our learned 1-D scheme – when combined with a splitting technique – can be used to predict 2-D advection, and is in some cases more stable and accurate than the low-resolution reference solver in 2-D. Overall, our results suggest that learned advection operators may offer a higher-accuracy method for accelerating CTM simulations as compared to simply running a traditional integrator at low resolution.},

Here, we applied ML to simulate the variability in urban ozone (O3) over Doon valley of the Himalaya. The ML model, trained with past variations in O3 and meteorological conditions, successfully reproduced the independent O3 data (r2 {\textasciitilde} 0.7). Model performance is found to be similar when the variation in major precursors (CO and NOx) were included in the model, instead of the meteorology. Further the inclusion of both precursors and meteorology improved the performance significantly (r2 = 0.86) and the model could also capture the outliers, which are crucial for air quality assessments. We suggest that in absence of high-resolution measurements, ML modeling has profound implications for unraveling the feedback between pollution and meteorology in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.},

	abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of ozone in climate change simulations, for example concerning global warming projections and atmospheric dynamics. However, fully interactive atmospheric chemistry schemes needed for calculating changes in ozone are computationally expensive. Climate modelers therefore often use climatological ozone fields, which are typically neither consistent with the actual climate state simulated by each model nor with the specific climate change scenario. This limitation applies in particular to standard modeling experiments such as preindustrial control or abrupt 4xCO2 climate sensitivity simulations. Here we suggest a novel method using a simple linear machine learning regression algorithm to predict ozone distributions for preindustrial and abrupt 4xCO2 simulations. Using the atmospheric temperature field as the only input, the regression reliably predicts three-dimensional ozone distributions at monthly to daily time intervals. In particular, the representation of stratospheric ozone variability is much improved compared with a fixed climatology, which is important for interactions with dynamical phenomena such as the polar vortices and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Our method requires training data covering only a fraction of the usual length of simulations and thus promises to be an important stepping stone towards a range of new computationally efficient methods to consider ozone changes in long climate simulations. We highlight key development steps to further improve and extend the scope of machine learning-based ozone parameterizations.},

	abstract = {Weaknesses in process representation in chemistry–climate models lead to biases in simulating surface ozone and to uncertainty in projections of future ozone change. We here develop a deep learning model to demonstrate the feasibility of ozone bias correction in a global chemistry–climate model. We apply this approach to identify the key factors causing ozone biases and to correct projections of future surface ozone. Temperature and the related geographic variables latitude and month show the strongest relationship with ozone biases. This indicates that ozone biases are sensitive to temperature and suggests weaknesses in representation of temperature-sensitive physical or chemical processes. Photolysis rates are also an important factor, highlighting the sensitivity of biases to simulated cloud cover and insolation. Atmospheric chemical species such as the hydroxyl radical, nitric acid and peroxyacyl nitrate show strong positive relationships with ozone biases on a regional scale. These relationships reveal the conditions under which ozone biases occur, although they reflect association rather than direct causation. We correct model projections of future ozone under different climate and emission scenarios following the shared socio-economic pathways. We find that changes in seasonal ozone mixing ratios from the present day to the future are generally smaller than those simulated without bias correction, especially in high-emission regions. This suggests that the ozone sensitivity to changing emissions and climate may be overestimated with chemistry–climate models. Given the uncertainty in simulating future ozone, we show that deep learning approaches can provide improved assessment of the impacts of climate and emission changes on future air quality, along with valuable information to guide future model development.},

A comprehensive data set was created based on thousands of individual detailed simulations, randomly initialized to account for the variety of atmospheric chemical environments. Recurrent random forests were trained to predict organic matter formation from dodecane and toluene precursors, and the partitioning between gas and particle phases. Validation tests show that the random forests perform well without any divergence over 10 days of simulations. The distribution of errors shows that the sampling of initial conditions for the training simulations needs to focus on chemical regimes where SOA production is the most sensitive. Sensitivity tests show that specializing multiple random forests for a specific chemical regime is not more efficient than training a single general random forest for the entire data set. The most important predictors are those providing information about the chemical regime, oxidants levels, and existing organic mass. The choice of predictors is crucial as using too many unimportant predictors reduces the performances of the random forests.},

Previous implementations of this adaptive solver suffered from excessive overhead in the repeated construction of the local Jacobian matrix or were hard-wired to specific mechanisms. Here we retain the general applicability of the method to any mechanism and avoid overhead by using pre-computed Jacobian matrix terms for the full mechanism and cropping the matrix locally to remove the slow species with no change in memory allocation. We apply this adaptive solver within KPP 3.0.0 to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry and demonstrate a 32\% reduction in solver time while maintaining a mean error lower than 1\% for key species in the troposphere.},

This study uses ground-level maximum daily 8-hour ozone average (MDA8 O3) as an example to examine O3 responses to local anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions in Taiwan by Response Surface Modeling (RSM). Three different datasets for RSM were examined, including the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model data, ML-measurement-model fusion (ML-MMF) data, and ML data, which respectively represent direct numerical model predictions, numerical predictions adjusted by observations and other auxiliary data, and ML predictions based on observations and other auxiliary data. The results show that both ML-MMF (r = 0.93–0.94) and ML predictions (r = 0.89–0.94) present significantly improved performance in the benchmark case compared with CMAQ predictions (r = 0.41–0.80). While ML-MMF isopleths exhibit O3 nonlinearity close to actual responses due to their numerical base and observation-based correction, ML isopleths present biased predictions concerning their different controlled ranges of O3 and distorted O3 responses to NOx and VOC emission ratios compared with ML-MMF isopleths, which implies that using data without support from CMAQ modeling to predict the air quality could mislead the controlled targets and future trends. Meanwhile, the observation-corrected ML-MMF isopleths also emphasize the impact of transboundary pollution from mainland China on the regional O3 sensitivity to local NOx and VOC emissions, which transboundary NOx would make all air quality regions in April more sensitive to local VOC emissions and limit the potential effort by reducing local emissions. Future ML applications in atmospheric science like forecasting or bias correction should provide interpretability and explainability, except for meeting statistical performance and providing variable importance. Assessment with interpretable physical and chemical mechanisms and constructing a statistically robust ML model should be equally important.},

	abstract = {Abstract With the impact of tropospheric ozone pollution on humankind, there is a compelling need for robust air quality forecasts. Here, we introduce a novel deep learning (DL) forecasting system called O3ResNet that produces a 4-day forecast for ground-level ozone. O3ResNet is based on a convolutional neural network with residual blocks. The model has been trained on 22 yr of ozone and nitrogen oxides in situ measurements and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2000 to 2021 at 328 stations in central Europe located in rural and suburban environments. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service regional forecast model ensemble for ground-level ozone with respect to the mean-square error and mean absolute error of the daily maximum 8-h running-average ozone, thus marking a major milestone for DL-based ozone prediction. O3ResNet has a very small bias without requiring additional postprocessing, and it generalizes well so that new stations can be added with no need to retrain the neural network. Because the model works on hourly data, it can be easily adapted to output other air quality metrics. We conclude that O3ResNet is sufficiently advanced and robust to become a test application for operational air quality forecasting with DL. Significance Statement In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning approach to forecast ground-level ozone for rural and suburban environments on a local scale. Our model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service regional ensemble forecast and is a major milestone toward a more reliable ozone prediction. This is important because local-scale ozone forecasts using conventional methods show significant bias or require site-dependent postprocessing. The findings suggest that the model presented in this article can become an important tool for air quality prediction.},

It is applied to development of an accurate and fast approximation of an atmospheric longwave radiation parameterization for the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model, which is the most time consuming component of model physics. The developed neural network emulation is two orders of magnitude, 50–80 times, faster than the original parameterization. A comparison of the parallel 10-yr climate simulations performed with the original parameterization and its neural network emulations confirmed that these simulations produce almost identical results. The obtained results show the conceptual and practical possibility of an efficient synergetic combination of deterministic and statistical learning components within an atmospheric climate or forecast model. A developmental framework and practical validation criteria for neural network emulations of model physics components are outlined.},

The developed highly accurate neural network emulations of the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations are 150 and 20 times as fast as the original/control longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations, respectively. The full neural network model radiation was used for a decadal climate model simulation with the NCAR CAM. A detailed comparison of parallel decadal climate simulations performed with the original NCAR model radiation parameterizations and with their neural network emulations is presented. Almost identical results have been obtained for the parallel decadal simulations. This opens the opportunity of using efficient neural network emulations for the full model radiation for decadal and longer climate simulations as well as for weather prediction.},

	abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

	abstract = {Ground-level ozone (GLO) has been widely recognized as a critical air pollutant that has the potential to induce various adverse environmental and health effects. To eliminate its hazardous impacts, the development of an accurate and effective approach to forecast the upcoming pollution concentration levels is in urgent need. Recent studies show that machine learning algorithms have excellent abilities in ground-level ozone concentration forecasting, however many of their forecasting models do not consider the contributing effects on meteorological measurements and traffic situations which were also identified as potential influencing factors to ground-level ozone concentration by some previous research. In the meantime, most of the existing models target short-term forecasting with rough temporal resolutions, such as daily and weekly scales. This paper aims to propose a methodology that can provide long-term GLO concentration forecasting with a high temporal resolution. To achieve this, a frequent pattern mining approach is utilized to analyze the local intercorrelation between GLO concentration and contributing factors such as meteorological parameters and transportation situations. Then, a series of machine learning algorithms were identified to forecast the ground-level ozone concentration levels using traffic and meteorological measurements data. A case study was conducted in the Houston region with 10 years of historical measurements, each of the historical ground-level ozone concentration records is associated with a series of meteorology and traffic situation parameters. Data from 2010 to 2019 was used to select and train the machine learning models, and data from 2020 was used to perform the final validation and evaluation. Results show that the extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm provides the most accurate prediction of the hourly ground-level ozone concentration on a yearly scale, which shows the annually forecasting ability and the robustness of the model built. The proposed approach could be applied to other similar regions and other critical air pollutants that are also influenced by transportation and meteorological factors.},

	abstract = {Surface ozone pollution in South Korea has increased over the past 2 decades, despite efforts to decrease emissions, and is pervasively in exceedance of the maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) standard of 60 ppb. Here, we investigate the 2015–2019 trends in surface ozone and NO2 concentrations over South Korea and the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA), focusing on the 90th percentile MDA8 ozone as an air quality metric. We use a random forest algorithm to remove the effect of meteorological variability on the 2015–2019 trends and find an ozone increase of up to 1.5 ppb a−1 in April–May, while NO2 decreases by 22 \%. Global 3-D atmospheric chemistry model simulations including recent chemical updates can successfully simulate surface ozone over South Korea and China as well as the very high free-tropospheric ozone observed above 2 km altitude (mean 75 ppb in May–June) and can reproduce the observed 2015–2019 emission-driven ozone trend over the SMA including its seasonality. Further investigation of the model trend for May, when meteorology-corrected ozone and its increase are the highest, reveals that a decrease in South Korea NOx emissions is the main driver for the SMA ozone increase. Although this result implies that decreasing volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions is necessary to decrease ozone, we find that ozone would still remain above 80 ppb even if all anthropogenic emissions in South Korea were shut off. China contributes only 8 ppb to this elevated South Korea background, and ship emissions contribute only a few parts per billion. Zeroing out all anthropogenic emissions in East Asia in the model indicates a remarkably high external background of 56 ppb, consistent with the high concentrations observed in the free troposphere, implying that the air quality standard in South Korea is not practically achievable unless this background external to East Asia can be decreased.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology that uses gradient-boosted regression trees (a machine learning technique) and a full-chemistry simulation (i.e., training dataset) from a chemistry–climate model (CCM) to efficiently generate a parameterization of tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) that is a function of chemical, dynamical, and solar irradiance variables. This surrogate model of OH is designed to be integrated into a CCM and allow for computationally efficient simulation of nonlinear feedbacks between OH and tropospheric constituents that have loss by reaction with OH as their primary sinks (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), volatile organic compounds (VOCs)). Such a model framework is advantageous for studies that require multi-decadal simulations of CH4 or multi-year sensitivity simulations to understand the causes of trends and variations of CO and CH4. To allow the user to easily target the training dataset towards a desired application, we are outlining a methodology to generate a parameterization of OH and not presenting an “off-the-shelf” version of a parameterization to be incorporated into a CCM. This provides for the relatively easy creation of a new parameterization in response to, for example, changes in research goals or the underlying CCM chemistry and/or dynamics schemes. We show that a sample parameterization of OH generated from a CCM simulation is able to reproduce OH concentrations with a normalized root-mean-square error of approximately 5 \% and capture the global mean methane lifetime within approximately 1 \%. Our calculated accuracy of the parameterization assumes inputs being within the bounds of the training dataset. Large excursions from these bounds will likely decrease the overall accuracy. However, we show that the sample parameterization predicts large deviations in OH for an El Niño event that was not part of the training dataset and that the spatial distribution and strength of these deviations are consistent with the event. This result gives confidence in the fidelity of a parameterization developed with our methodology to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of OH to perturbations from large variations in the chemical, dynamical, and solar irradiance drivers of OH. In addition, we discuss how two machine learning metrics, Gain feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values, indicate that the behavior of a parameterization of OH generally accords with our understanding of OH chemistry, even though there are no physics- or chemistry-based constraints on the parameterization.},

We develop a predictor for the bias in tropospheric ozone (O3, a key pollutant) calculated by an atmospheric chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem), based on outputs from the model and observations of ozone from both the surface (EPA, EMEP, and GAW) and the ozone-sonde networks. We train a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) to predict model bias (model divided by observation), with model and observational data for 2010–2015, and then we test the approach using the years 2016–2017. We show that the bias-corrected model performs considerably better than the uncorrected model. The root-mean-square error is reduced from 16.2 to 7.5\&thinsp;ppb, the normalized mean bias is reduced from 0.28 to −0.04, and Pearson's R is increased from 0.48 to 0.84. Comparisons with observations from the NASA ATom flights (which were not included in the training) also show improvements but to a smaller extent, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 12.1 to 10.5\&thinsp;ppb, reducing the normalized mean bias (NMB) from 0.08 to 0.06, and increasing Pearson's R from 0.76 to 0.79. We attribute the smaller improvements to the lack of routine observational constraints for much of the remote troposphere. We show that the method is robust to variations in the volume of training data, with approximately a year of data needed to produce useful performance. Data denial experiments (removing observational sites from the algorithm training) show that information from one location (for example Europe) can reduce the model bias over other locations (for example North America) which might provide insights into the processes controlling the model bias. We explore the choice of predictor (bias prediction versus direct prediction) and conclude both may have utility. We conclude that combining machine learning approaches with process-based models may provide a useful tool for improving these models.},

All of these models employ some form of operator splitting, also called the method of fractional steps, in their structure, which enables each physical or chemical process to be simulated in a separate operator or module within the overall model. In this structure, each of the modules calculates property changes for a fixed period of time; that is, property values are passed into the module, which calculates how they change for a period of time and then returns the new property values, all in round-robin between the various modules of the model. Some of these modules require the vast majority of the computer resources consumed by the entire model, so increasing their computational efficiency can either improve the model's computational performance, enable more realistic physical or chemical representations in the module, or a combination of these two. Recent efforts have attempted to replace these modules with ones that use machine learning tools to memorize the input–output relationships of the most time-consuming modules. One shortcoming of some of the original modules and their machine-learned replacements is lack of adherence to conservation principles that are essential to model performance. In this work, we derive a mathematical framework for machine-learned replacements that conserves properties – say mass, atoms, or energy – to machine precision. This framework can be used to develop machine-learned operator replacements in environmental models.},

	abstract = {Warm-sector heavy rainfall along the south China coast poses significant forecasting challenges due to its localized nature and prolonged duration. To improve the prediction of such high-impact weather events, high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are increasingly used to more accurately represent topographic effects. However, as these models' grid spacing approaches the scale of convective processes, they enter a “gray zone”, where the models struggle to fully resolve the turbulent eddies within the atmospheric boundary layer, necessitating partial parameterization. The appropriateness of applying convection parameterization (CP) schemes within this gray zone remains controversial. To address this, scale-aware CP schemes have been developed to improve the representation of convective transport. Among these, the multi-scale Kain–Fritsch (MSKF) scheme enhances the traditional Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme, incorporating modifications that facilitate its effective application at spatial resolutions as high as 2 km. In recent years, there has been an increase in the application of machine learning (ML) models across various domains of atmospheric sciences, including efforts to replace conventional physical parameterizations with ML models. This work introduces a multi-output bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model intended to replace the scale-aware MSKF CP scheme. This multi-output Bi-LSTM model is capable of simultaneously predicting the convection trigger while also modeling the associated convective tendencies and precipitation rates with a high performance. Data for training and testing the model are generated using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model over south China at a horizontal resolution of 5 km. Furthermore, this work evaluates the performance of the WRF model coupled with the ML-based CP scheme against simulations with the traditional MSKF scheme. The results demonstrate that the Bi-LSTM model can achieve high accuracy, indicating the promising potential of ML models to substitute the MSKF scheme in the gray zone.},

	abstract = {Global modeling of atmospheric chemistry is a great computational challenge because of the cost of integrating the kinetic equations for chemical mechanisms with typically over 100 coupled species. Here we present an adaptive algorithm to ease this computational bottleneck with no significant loss in accuracy and apply it to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model for tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry (228 species, 724 reactions). Our approach is inspired by unsupervised machine learning clustering techniques and traditional asymptotic analysis ideas. We locally define species in the mechanism as fast or slow on the basis of their total production and loss rates, and we solve the coupled kinetic system only for the fast species assembled in a submechanism of the full mechanism. To avoid computational overhead, we first partition the species from the full mechanism into 13 blocks, using a machine learning approach that analyzes the chemical linkages between species and their correlated presence as fast or slow in the global model domain. Building on these blocks, we then preselect 20 submechanisms, as defined by unique assemblages of the species blocks, and then pick locally and on the fly which submechanism to use in the model based on local chemical conditions. In each submechanism, we isolate slow species and slow reactions from the coupled system of fast species to be solved. Because many species in the full mechanism are important only in source regions, we find that we can reduce the effective size of the mechanism by 70 \% globally without sacrificing complexity where/when it is needed. The computational cost of the chemical integration decreases by 50 \% with relative biases smaller than 2 \% for important species over 8-year simulations. Changes to the full mechanism including the addition of new species can be accommodated by adding these species to the relevant blocks without having to reconstruct the suite of submechanisms.},

We present an adaptive method to greatly reduce the computational cost of that numerical integration in global 3-D models while maintaining high accuracy. Most of the atmosphere does not in fact require solving for the full chemical complexity of the mechanism, so considerable simplification is possible if one can recognize the dynamic continuum of chemical complexity required across the atmospheric domain. We do this by constructing a limited set of reduced chemical mechanisms (chemical regimes) to cover the range of atmospheric conditions and then pick locally and on the fly which mechanism to use for a given grid box and time step on the basis of computed production and loss rates for individual species. Application to the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model for oxidant–aerosol chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere (full mechanism of 228 species) is presented. We show that 20 chemical regimes can largely encompass the range of conditions encountered in the model. Results from a 2-year GEOS-Chem simulation shows that our method can reduce the computational cost of chemical integration by 30\&thinsp;\%–40\&thinsp;\% while maintaining accuracy better than 1\&thinsp;\% and with no error growth. Our method retains the full complexity of the original chemical mechanism where it is needed, provides the same model output diagnostics (species production and loss rates, reaction rates) as the full mechanism, and can accommodate changes in the chemical mechanism or in model resolution without having to reconstruct the chemical regimes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric chemistry models?components in models that simulate air pollution and climate change?are computationally expensive. Previous studies have shown that machine-learned atmospheric chemical solvers can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional integration methods but tend to suffer from numerical instability. Here, we present a modeling framework that reduces error accumulation compared to previous work while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach is novel in that it (1) uses a recurrent training regime that results in extended ({\textgreater}1 week) simulations without exponential error accumulation and (2) can reversibly compress the number of modeled chemical species by {\textgreater}80\% without further decreasing accuracy. We observe an {\textasciitilde}260? speedup ({\textasciitilde}1,900? with specialized hardware) compared to the traditional solver. We use random initial conditions in training to promote general applicability across a wide range of atmospheric conditions. For ozone (concentrations ranging from 0?70 ppb), our model predictions over a 24-hr simulation period match those of the reference solver with median error of 2.7 and {\textless}19 ppb error across 99\% of simulations initialized with random noise. Error can be significantly higher in the remaining 1\% of simulations, which include extreme concentration fluctuations simulated by the reference model. Results are similar for total particulate matter (median error of 16 and {\textless}32 ?g/m3 across 99\% of simulations with concentrations ranging from 0?150 ?g/m3). Finally, we discuss practical implications of our modeling framework and next steps for improvements. The machine learning models described here are not yet replacements for traditional chemistry solvers but represent a step toward that goal.},

From this data set we train random forest regression models to predict the concentration of each transported species after the integrator, based on the physical and chemical conditions before the integrator. The choice of prediction type has a strong impact on the skill of the regression model. We find best results from predicting the change in concentration for long-lived species and the absolute concentration for short-lived species.

The biases become largest in remote areas such as the tropical Pacific where errors in the chemistry can accumulate with little balancing influence from emissions or deposition.

Offline chemical transport models (CTMs), where the chemical continuity equations are solved using meteorological data as input, have usability advantages and are important vehicles for developing atmospheric chemistry knowledge that can then be transferred to Earth system models. However, they have generally not been designed to take advantage of massively parallel computing architectures. Here, we develop such a high-performance capability for GEOS-Chem (GCHP), a CTM driven by meteorological data from the NASA Goddard Earth Observation System (GEOS) and used by hundreds of research groups worldwide.

GCHP also allows GEOS-Chem to take advantage of the native GEOS cubed-sphere grid for greater accuracy and computational efficiency in simulating transport.

Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning–based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. —H.

	abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

The hourly data for air pollutants and meteorological variables, obtained both at the surface and at the high elevation (500 hPa) stations of Seoul City for the period of 1989–1999, were analyzed. Two types of forecast models are developed. The first model, Part I, uses a fuzzy expert system and forecasts the possibility of high ozone levels (equal to or above 80 ppb) occurring on the next day. The second model, Part II, uses a neural network system to forecast the daily maximum concentration of ozone on the following day. The forecasting system includes a correction function so that the existing model can be updated whenever a new ozone episode appears. The accuracy of the forecasting system has been improved continuously through verification and augmentation.},

Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10\% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate real-time forecasting of national spatial ozone distribution is critical to the provision of effective early warning. Traditional numerical air quality models require a high computational cost associated with running large-scale numerical simulations. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model (VAE-GAN) combining a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the dynamic ozone distributions in spatial and temporal spaces. The VAE-GAN model can not only decipher the complex nonlinear relationship between the inputs (the past states/ozone and meteorological factors) and outputs (ozone), but also provide ozone forecasts for a long lead-time beyond the training period. The performance of VAE-GAN is demonstrated in hourly and daily spatio-temporal ozone forecasts over China. The training datasets from 2013 to 2017 and validation datasets from 2018 to 2019 are the collection of data from the air quality reanalysis datasets. With the use of VAE, large dataset sizes are decreased by three orders of magnitude, enabling hourly and daily forecasts to be computed in seconds. Results show that the VAE-GAN achieves a reasonable accuracy in the prediction of both the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of hourly and daily ozone fields, as compared to the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (commonly used in China), the reanalysis data and observations during the validation period. Thus, the VAE-GAN is a cost-effective tool for large data-driven predictions, which can potentially reinforce air pollution prediction efforts in providing risk assessment and management in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {Introduction of high-performing crop cultivars and crop/soil water management practices that increase the stomatal uptake of carbon dioxide and photosynthesis will be instrumental in realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving food security. To date, however, global assessments of how to increase crop yield have failed to consider the negative effects of tropospheric ozone, a gaseous pollutant that enters the leaf stomatal pores of plants along with carbon dioxide, and is increasing in concentration globally, particularly in rapidly developing countries. Earlier studies have simply estimated that the largest effects are in the areas with the highest ozone concentrations. Using a modelling method that accounts for the effects of soil moisture deficit and meteorological factors on the stomatal uptake of ozone, we show for the first time that ozone impacts on wheat yield are particularly large in humid rain-fed and irrigated areas of major wheat-producing countries (e.g. United States, France, India, China and Russia). Averaged over 2010–2012, we estimate that ozone reduces wheat yields by a mean 9.9\% in the northern hemisphere and 6.2\% in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to some 85 Tg (million tonnes) of lost grain. Total production losses in developing countries receiving Official Development Assistance are 50\% higher than those in developed countries, potentially reducing the possibility of achieving UN SDG2. Crucially, our analysis shows that ozone could reduce the potential yield benefits of increasing irrigation usage in response to climate change because added irrigation increases the uptake and subsequent negative effects of the pollutant. We show that mitigation of air pollution in a changing climate could play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned UN SDG, while also contributing to other SDGs related to human health and well-being, ecosystems and climate change.},

In addition, RF is calculated for ozone fields prepared as an input for CMIP6 models without chemistry schemes and from a chemical transport model simulation. A radiative kernel for ozone is constructed and used to derive the RF. The ozone RF in 2010 (2005–2014) relative to 1850 is 0.35 W m−2 [0.08–0.61] (5–95\% uncertainty range) based on models with both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. One of these models has a negative present-day total ozone RF. Excluding this model, the present-day ozone RF increases to 0.39 W m−2 [0.27–0.51] (5–95\% uncertainty range). The rest of the models have RF close to or stronger than the RF time series assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the fifth assessment report with the primary driver likely being the new precursor emissions used in CMIP6. The rapid adjustments beyond stratospheric temperature are estimated to be weak and thus the RF is a good measure of effective radiative forcing.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based retrievals of tropospheric NO2 columns are widely used to infer NOx (≡ NO + NO2) emissions. These retrievals rely on model information for the vertical distribution of NO2. The free tropospheric background above 2 km is particularly important because the sensitivity of the retrievals increases with altitude. Free tropospheric NOx also has a strong effect on tropospheric OH and ozone concentrations. Here we use observations from three aircraft campaigns (SEAC4RS, DC3, and ATom) and four atmospheric chemistry models (GEOS-Chem, GMI, TM5, and CAMS) to evaluate the model capabilities for simulating NOx in the free troposphere and attribute it to sources. NO2 measurements during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) and Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaigns over the southeastern U.S. in summer show increasing concentrations in the upper troposphere above 10 km, which are not replicated by the GEOS-Chem, although the model is consistent with the NO measurements. Using concurrent NO, NO2, and ozone observations from a DC3 flight in a thunderstorm outflow, we show that the NO2 measurements in the upper troposphere are biased high, plausibly due to interference from thermally labile NO2 reservoirs such as peroxynitric acid (HNO4) and methyl peroxy nitrate (MPN). We find that NO2 concentrations calculated from the NO measurements and NO–NO2 photochemical steady state (PSS) are more reliable to evaluate the vertical profiles of NO2 in models. GEOS-Chem reproduces the shape of the PSS-inferred NO2 profiles throughout the troposphere for SEAC4RS and DC3 but overestimates NO2 concentrations by about a factor of 2. The model underestimates MPN and alkyl nitrate concentrations, suggesting missing organic NOx chemistry. On the other hand, the standard GEOS-Chem model underestimates NO observations from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) campaigns over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating a missing NOx source over the oceans. We find that we can account for this missing source by including in the model the photolysis of particulate nitrate on sea salt aerosols at rates inferred from laboratory studies and field observations of nitrous acid (HONO) over the Atlantic. The median PSS-inferred tropospheric NO2 column density for the ATom campaign is 1.7 ± 0.44 × 1014 molec. cm−2, and the NO2 column density simulated by the four models is in the range of 1.4–2.4 × 1014 molec. cm−2, implying that the uncertainty from using modeled NO2 tropospheric columns over clean areas in the retrievals for stratosphere–troposphere separation is about 1 × 1014 molec. cm−2. We find from GEOS-Chem that lightning is the main primary NOx source in the free troposphere over the tropics and southern midlatitudes, but aircraft emissions dominate at northern midlatitudes in winter and in summer over the oceans. Particulate nitrate photolysis increases ozone concentrations by up to 5 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) in the free troposphere in the northern extratropics in the model, which would largely correct the low model bias relative to ozonesonde observations. Global tropospheric OH concentrations increase by 19 \%. The contribution of the free tropospheric background to the tropospheric NO2 columns observed by satellites over the contiguous U.S. increases from 25 ± 11 \% in winter to 65 ± 9 \% in summer, according to the GEOS-Chem vertical profiles. This needs to be accounted for when deriving NOx emissions from satellite NO2 column measurements.},

The data assimilation simultaneously optimizes both concentrations and emissions of multiple species through ingestion of a suite of measurements (ozone, NO2, CO, HNO3) from multiple satellite sensors. In spite of substantial model differences, the observational density and accuracy was sufficient for the assimilation to reduce the multi-model spread by 20\&thinsp;\%–85\&thinsp;\% for ozone and annual mean bias by 39\&thinsp;\%–97\&thinsp;\% for ozone in the middle troposphere, while simultaneously reducing the tropospheric NO2 column biases by more than 40\&thinsp;\% and the negative biases of surface CO in the Northern Hemisphere by 41\&thinsp;\%–94\&thinsp;\%. For tropospheric mean OH, the multi-model mean meridional hemispheric gradient was reduced from 1.32±0.03 to 1.19±0.03, while the multi-model spread was reduced by 24\&thinsp;\%–58\&thinsp;\% over polluted areas. The uncertainty ranges in the a posteriori emissions due to model errors were quantified in 4\&thinsp;\%–31\&thinsp;\% for NOx and 13\&thinsp;\%–35\&thinsp;\% for CO regional emissions. Harnessing assimilation increments in both NOx and ozone, we show that the sensitivity of ozone and NO2 surface concentrations to NOx emissions varied by a factor of 2 for end-member models, revealing fundamental differences in the representation of fast chemical and dynamical processes. A systematic investigation of model ozone response and analysis increment in MOMO-Chem could benefit evaluation of future prediction of the chemistry–climate system as a hierarchical emergent constraint.},

	abstract = {Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather, to planning renewable energy use. Here, we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ensemble forecast, ENS. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.4\% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, where critical weather-dependent decisions are made with greater accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Dry deposition of ozone is an important sink of ozone in near-surface air. When dry deposition occurs through plant stomata, ozone can injure the plant, altering water and carbon cycling and reducing crop yields. Quantifying both stomatal and nonstomatal uptake accurately is relevant for understanding ozone's impact on human health as an air pollutant and on climate as a potent short-lived greenhouse gas and primary control on the removal of several reactive greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Robust ozone dry deposition estimates require knowledge of the relative importance of individual deposition pathways, but spatiotemporal variability in nonstomatal deposition is poorly understood. Here we integrate understanding of ozone deposition processes by synthesizing research from fields such as atmospheric chemistry, ecology, and meteorology. We critically review methods for measurements and modeling, highlighting the empiricism that underpins modeling and thus the interpretation of observations. Our unprecedented synthesis of knowledge on deposition pathways, particularly soil and leaf cuticles, reveals process understanding not yet included in widely used models. If coordinated with short-term field intensives, laboratory studies, and mechanistic modeling, measurements from a few long-term sites would bridge the molecular to ecosystem scales necessary to establish the relative importance of individual deposition pathways and the extent to which they vary in space and time. Our recommended approaches seek to close knowledge gaps that currently limit quantifying the impact of ozone dry deposition on air quality, ecosystems, and climate.},

	abstract = {Severe surface ozone pollution over major Chinese cities has become an emerging air quality concern, raising a new challenge for emission control measures in China. In this study, we explore the source contributions to surface daily maximum 8\&thinsp;h average (MDA8) ozone over China in 2016 and 2017, the 2 years with the highest surface ozone averaged over Chinese cities in record. We estimate the contributions of anthropogenic, background, and individual natural sources to surface ozone over China using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25∘×0.3125∘ horizontal resolution with the most up-to-date Chinese anthropogenic emission inventory. Model results are evaluated with concurrent surface ozone measurements at 169 cities over China and show generally good agreement. We find that background ozone (defined as ozone that would be present in the absence of all Chinese anthropogenic emissions) accounts for 90\&thinsp;\% (49.4\&thinsp;ppbv) of the national March–April mean surface MDA8 ozone over China and 80\&thinsp;\% (44.5\&thinsp;ppbv) for May–August. It includes large contributions from natural sources (80\&thinsp;\% in March–April and 72\&thinsp;\% in May–August). Among them, biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions enhance MDA8 ozone by more than 15\&thinsp;ppbv in eastern China during July–August, while lightning NOx emissions and ozone transport from the stratosphere both lead to ozone enhancements of over 20\&thinsp;ppbv in western China during March–April. Over major Chinese city clusters, domestic anthropogenic sources account for about 30\&thinsp;\% of the May–August mean surface MDA8 ozone and reach 39–73\&thinsp;ppbv (38\&thinsp;\%–69\&thinsp;\%) for days with simulated MDA8 ozone \&gt; 100\&thinsp;ppbv in the North China Plain, Fenwei Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta city clusters. These high ozone episodes are usually associated with high temperatures, which induce large BVOC emissions and enhance ozone chemical production. Our results indicate that there would be no days with MDA8 ozone \&gt; 80\&thinsp;ppbv in these major Chinese cities in the absence of domestic anthropogenic emissions. We find that the 2017 ozone increases relative to 2016 are largely due to higher background ozone driven by hotter and drier weather conditions, while changes in domestic anthropogenic emissions alone would have led to ozone decreases in 2017. Meteorological conditions in 2017 favor natural source contributions (particularly soil NOx and BVOC ozone enhancements) and ozone chemical production, increase the thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and further decrease ozone dry deposition velocity. More stringent emission control measures are thus required to offset the adverse effects of unfavorable meteorology, such as high temperature, on surface ozone air quality.},

	abstract = {Observational records of meteorological and chemical variables are imprinted by an unknown combination of anthropogenic activity, natural forcings, and internal variability. With a 15-member initial-condition ensemble generated from the CESM2-WACCM6 chemistry-climate model for 1950–2014, we extract signals of anthropogenic (‘forced’) change from the noise of internally arising climate variability on observed tropospheric ozone trends. Positive trends in free tropospheric ozone measured at long-term surface observatories, by commercial aircraft, and retrieved from satellite instruments generally fall within the ensemble range. CESM2-WACCM6 tropospheric ozone trends are also bracketed by those in a larger ensemble constructed from five additional chemistry-climate models. Comparison of the multi-model ensemble with observed tropospheric column ozone trends in the northern tropics implies an underestimate in regional precursor emission growth over recent decades. Positive tropospheric ozone trends clearly emerge from 1950 to 2014, exceeding 0.2 DU yr−1 at 20–40 N in all CESM2-WACCM6 ensemble members. Tropospheric ozone observations are often only available for recent decades, and we show that even a two-decade record length is insufficient to eliminate the role of internal variability, which can produce regional tropospheric ozone trends oppositely signed from ensemble mean (forced) changes. By identifying regions and seasons with strong anthropogenic change signals relative to internal variability, initial-condition ensembles can guide future observing systems seeking to detect anthropogenic change. For example, analysis of the CESM2-WACCM6 ensemble reveals year-round upper tropospheric ozone increases from 1995 to 2014, largest at 30 S–40 N during boreal summer. Lower tropospheric ozone increases most strongly in the winter hemisphere, and internal variability leads to trends of opposite sign (ensemble overlaps zero) north of 40 N during boreal summer. This decoupling of ozone trends in the upper and lower troposphere suggests a growing prominence for tropospheric ozone as a greenhouse gas despite regional efforts to abate warm season ground-level ozone.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Despite decades of effort, the drivers of global long-term trends in tropospheric ozone are not well understood, impacting estimates of ozone radiative forcing and the global ozone budget. We analyze tropospheric ozone trends since 1980 using ozonesondes and remote surface measurements around the globe and investigate the ability of two atmospheric chemical transport models, GEOS-Chem and MERRA2-GMI, to reproduce these trends. Global tropospheric ozone trends measured at 25 ozonesonde sites from 1990–2017 (9 sites since 1980s) show increasing trends averaging 2.1 ± 1.3 ppb decade-1 across sites in the free troposphere (800–400 hPa). Relative trends in sondes are more pronounced closer to the surface (5.1 \% decade-1 above 700 hPa, 4.0 \% decade-1 below 700 hPa on average), suggesting the importance of emissions in observed changes. While most surface sites (148 of 238) in the United States and Europe exhibit decreases in high daytime ozone values due to regulatory efforts, 73 \% of global sites outside those regions (24 of 33 sites) show increases from 1990–2014 that average 1.4 ± 0.9 ppb decade-1. In all regions, increasing ozone trends both at the surface and aloft are at least partially attributable to increases in 5th percentile ozone, which average 1.7 ± 1.0 ppb decade-1 and reflect the global increase of background ozone. Observed ozone percentile distributions at the surface have shifted notably across the globe: all regions show increases in low tails (i.e., below 25th percentile), North America and Europe show decreases in high tails (above 75th percentile), and the Southern Hemisphere and Japan show increases across the entire distribution. Three model simulations comprising different emissions inventories, chemical schemes, and resolutions, sampled at the same locations and times of observations, are not able to replicate long-term ozone trends either at the surface or free troposphere, often underestimating trends. We find that {\textasciitilde}60 \% of the average ozone trend from 800–400 hPa across the 25 ozonesonde sites is captured by MERRA2-GMI and {\textless}15 \% is captured by GEOS-Chem. MERRA2-GMI performs better than GEOS-Chem in the northern mid-latitude free troposphere, reproducing 71 \% of increasing trends since 1990 and capturing stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) determined via a stratospheric ozone tracer. While all models tend to capture the direction of shifts in the ozone distribution and typically capture changes in high and low tails, they tend to underestimate the magnitude of the shift in medians. However, each model shows an 8–12 \% (or 23–32 Tg) increase in total tropospheric ozone burden from 1980 to 2017. Sensitivity simulations using GEOS-Chem and the stratospheric ozone tracer in MERRA2-GMI suggest that in the northern mid- and high latitudes, dynamics such as STE are most important for reproducing ozone trends in models in the middle and upper troposphere, while emissions are more important closer to the surface. Our model evaluation for the last 4 decades reveals that the recent version of the GEOS-Chem model underpredicts free tropospheric ozone across this long time period, particularly in winter and spring over mid-to high latitudes. Such widespread model underestimation of tropospheric ozone highlights the need for better understanding of the processes that transport ozone and promote its production.},

	abstract = {Past studies have suggested that ozone in the troposphere has increased globally throughout much of the 20th century due to increases in anthropogenic emissions and transport. We show, by combining satellite measurements with a chemical transport model, that during the last four decades tropospheric ozone does indeed indicate increases that are global in nature, yet still highly regional. Satellite ozone measurements from Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) are merged with ozone measurements from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) to determine trends in tropospheric ozone for 1979–2016. Both TOMS (1979–2005) and OMI/MLS (2005–2016) depict large increases in tropospheric ozone from the Near East to India and East Asia and further eastward over the Pacific Ocean. The 38-year merged satellite record shows total net change over this region of about +6 to +7 Dobson units (DU) (i.e., ∼15\&thinsp;\%–20\&thinsp;\% of average background ozone), with the largest increase (∼4\&thinsp;DU) occurring during the 2005–2016 Aura period. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model with time-varying emissions is used to aid in the interpretation of tropospheric ozone trends for 1980–2016. The GMI simulation for the combined record also depicts the greatest increases of +6 to +7\&thinsp;DU over India and East Asia, very similar to the satellite measurements. In regions of significant increases in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) the trends are a factor of 2–2.5 larger for the Aura record when compared to the earlier TOMS record; for India and East Asia the trends in TCO for both GMI and satellite measurements are ∼+3\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 or greater during 2005–2016 compared to about +1.2 to +1.4\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 for 1979–2005. The GMI simulation and satellite data also reveal a tropospheric ozone increases in ∼+4 to +5\&thinsp;DU for the 38-year record over central Africa and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Both the GMI simulation and satellite-measured tropospheric ozone during the latter Aura time period show increases of ∼+3\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade−1 over the N Atlantic and NE Pacific.},

	abstract = {The goal of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) is to provide the research community with an up-to-date scientific assessment of tropospheric ozone, from the surface to the tropopause. While a suite of observations provides significant information on the spatial and temporal distribution of tropospheric ozone, observational gaps make it necessary to use global atmospheric chemistry models to synthesize our understanding of the processes and variables that control tropospheric ozone abundance and its variability. Models facilitate the interpretation of the observations and allow us to make projections of future tropospheric ozone and trace gas distributions for different anthropogenic or natural perturbations. This paper assesses the skill of current-generation global atmospheric chemistry models in simulating the observed present-day tropospheric ozone distribution, variability, and trends. Drawing upon the results of recent international multi-model intercomparisons and using a range of model evaluation techniques, we demonstrate that global chemistry models are broadly skillful in capturing the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric ozone over the seasonal cycle, for extreme pollution episodes, and changes over interannual to decadal periods. However, models are consistently biased high in the northern hemisphere and biased low in the southern hemisphere, throughout the depth of the troposphere, and are unable to replicate particular metrics that define the longer term trends in tropospheric ozone as derived from some background sites. When the models compare unfavorably against observations, we discuss the potential causes of model biases and propose directions for future developments, including improved evaluations that may be able to better diagnose the root cause of the model-observation disparity. Overall, model results should be approached critically, including determining whether the model performance is acceptable for the problem being addressed, whether biases can be tolerated or corrected, whether the model is appropriately constituted, and whether there is a way to satisfactorily quantify the uncertainty.},

We simulated a 15 year period (1979–1993) on the basis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts meteorological reanalyses and a time-varying emission data set. We calculate that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) strongly contributes to O3 in regions where the photochemistry is quiescent. Since such regions play a minor role in radiative and chemical processes, we argue that STE-derived O3 is much less important than is suggested by its column abundance. By distinguishing between photochemical pathways in the model we calculate that tropospheric O3 in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere is strongly affected by industrial and fossil fuel-related emissions. In the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, natural emissions still play a major role. Our model results indicate a less important role for man-made biomass burning emissions than previous analyses. Further, the results show that tropospheric O3 trends are strongly influenced by transports of pollution and by meteorological variability. Scenario calculations for the year 2025 suggest that man-made emissions at low northern latitudes, in particular in southern and eastern Asia, will become a very strong tropospheric O3 source in the next decades. This will influence O3 levels on a hemispheric scale so that despite pollution regulations in Europe and North America, surface O3 will continue to grow.},

We develop a novel data-driven ensembling strategy for combining geophysical models using Bayesian Neural Networks, which infers spatiotemporally varying model weights and bias while accounting for heteroscedastic uncertainties in the observations. This produces more accurate and uncertainty-aware projections without sacrificing interpretability. Applied to the prediction of total column ozone from an ensemble of 15 chemistry-climate models, we find that the Bayesian neural network ensemble (BayNNE) outperforms existing ensembling methods, achieving a 49.4\% reduction in RMSE for temporal extrapolation, and a 67.4\% reduction in RMSE for polar data voids, compared to a weighted mean. Uncertainty is also well-characterized, with 90.6\% of the data points in our extrapolation validation dataset lying within 2 standard deviations and 98.5\% within 3 standard deviations.},

	abstract = {Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) in the United States have declined significantly during the past three decades. However, satellite observations since 2009 indicate total column NO2 is no longer declining even as bottom-up inventories suggest continued decline in emissions. Multiple explanations have been proposed for this discrepancy including (a) the increasing relative importance of nonurban NOx to total column NO2, (b) differences between background and urban NOx lifetimes, and (c) that the actual NOx emissions are declining more slowly after 2009. Here, we use a deep learning model trained by NOx emissions and surface observations of ozone to assess consistency between the reported NOx trends between 2005 and 2014 and observations of surface ozone. We find that the satellite-derived trends best reproduce ozone in low NOx emission (background) regions. The 2010–2014 trend from older satellite-derived emission estimates produced at low spatial resolution results in the largest bias in surface ozone in regions with high NOx emissions, reflecting the blending of urban and background NOx in these low-resolution top-down analyses. In contrast, the trend from higher resolution satellite-based estimates, which are more capable of capturing the urban emission signature, is in better agreement with ozone in high NOx emission regions, and is consistent with the trend based on surface observations of NO2. Our results confirm that the satellite-derived trends reflect anthropogenic and background influences.},

	abstract = {Current AutoML systems have been benchmarked with traditional natural image datasets. Differences between satellite images and natural images (e.g., bit-wise resolution, the number, and type of spectral bands) and lack of labeled satellite images for training models, pose open questions about the applicability of current AutoML systems on satellite data. In this paper, we demonstrate how AutoML can be leveraged for classification tasks on satellite data. Specifically, we deploy the Auto-Keras system for image classification tasks and create two new variants, IMG-AK and RS-AK, for satellite image classification that respectively incorporate transfer learning using models pre-trained with (i) natural images (using ImageNet) and (ii) remote sensing datasets. For evaluation, we compared the performance of these variants against manually designed architectures on a benchmark set of 7 satellite datasets. Our results show that in 71\% of the cases the AutoML systems outperformed the best previously proposed model, highlighting the usefulness of a customized satellite data search space in AutoML systems. Our RS-AK variant performed better than IMG-AK for small datasets with a limited amount of training data. Furthermore, it found the best automated model for the datasets composed of near-infrared, green, and red bands.},

The BigEarthNet consists of 590, 326 Sentinel-2 image patches, each of which is a section of i) 120 × 120 pixels for 10m bands; ii) 60×60 pixels for 20m bands; and iii) 20×20 pixels for 60m bands. Unlike most of the existing archives, each image patch is annotated by multiple land-cover classes (i.e., multi-labels) that are provided from the CORINE Land Cover database of the year 2018 (CLC 2018). The BigEarthNet is significantly larger than the existing archives in remote sensing (RS) and thus is much more convenient to be used as a training source in the context of deep learning. This paper first addresses the limitations of the existing archives and then describes the properties of the BigEarthNet. Experimental results obtained in the framework of RS image scene classification problems show that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on the BigEarthNet provides much higher accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet (which is a very popular large-scale benchmark archive in computer vision). The BigEarthNet opens up promising directions to advance operational RS applications and research in massive Sentinel-2 image archives.},

	abstract = {We review model simulations from the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative to assess the changes in the tropospheric ozone burden and its budget from 1850 to 2010. Analysis of these data indicates that there has been significant growth in the ozone burden from 1850 to 2000 (approximately 43 + 9\%) but smaller growth between 1960 and 2000 (approximately 16 + 10\%) and that the models simulate burdens of ozone well within recent satellite estimates. The Chemistry Climate Modelling Initiative model ozone budgets indicate that the net chemical production of ozone in the troposphere plateaued in the 1990s and has not changed since then inspite of increases in the burden. There has been a shift in net ozone production in the troposphere being greatest in the northern mid and high latitudes to the northern tropics, driven by the regional evolution of precursor emissions. An analysis of the evolution of tropospheric ozone through the 21st century, as simulated by Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, reveals a large source of uncertainty associated with models themselves (i.e., in the way that they simulate the chemical and physical processes that control tropospheric ozone). This structural uncertainty is greatest in the near term (two to three decades), but emissions scenarios dominate uncertainty in the longer term (2050–2100) evolution of tropospheric ozone. This intrinsic model uncertainty prevents robust predictions of near-term changes in the tropospheric ozone burden, and we review how progress can be made to reduce this limitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone–climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric scales. New observational opportunities are offered both by satellites and small sensors that bridge the scales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relative risk estimates for long-term ozone (O3) exposure and respiratory mortality from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (ACS CPS-II) cohort have been used to estimate global O3-attributable mortality in adults. Updated relative risk estimates are now available for the same cohort based on an expanded study population with longer follow-up.
OBJECTIVES: We estimated the global burden and spatial distribution of respiratory mortality attributable to long-term O3 exposure in adults ≥30 y of age using updated eﬀect estimates from the ACS CPS-II cohort.
METHODS: We used GEOS-Chem simulations (2 × 2:5  grid resolution) to estimate annual O3 exposures, and estimated total respiratory deaths in 2010 that were attributable to long-term annual O3 exposure based on the updated relative risk estimates and minimum risk thresholds set at the minimum or ﬁfth percentile of O3 exposure in the most recent CPS-II analysis. These estimates were compared with attributable mortality based on the earlier CPS-II analysis, using 6-mo average exposures and risk thresholds corresponding to the minimum or ﬁfth percentile of O3 exposure in the earlier study population.
RESULTS: We estimated 1.04–1.23 million respiratory deaths in adults attributable to O3 exposures using the updated relative risk estimate and exposure parameters, compared with 0.40–0.55 million respiratory deaths attributable to O3 exposures based on the earlier CPS-II risk estimate and parameters. Increases in estimated attributable mortality were larger in northern India, southeast China, and Pakistan than in Europe, eastern United States, and northeast China.
CONCLUSIONS: These ﬁndings suggest that the potential magnitude of health beneﬁts of air quality policies targeting O3, health co-beneﬁts of climate mitigation policies, and health implications of climate change-driven changes in O3 concentrations, are larger than previously thought. https://doi.org/ 10.1289/EHP1390},

The interpolated ozone concentration fields were constructed using 15 building sites whose daily trends were predicted by random forest regression. Spatially interpolated ozone concentrations were evaluated at 12 sites that were independent from the machine learning sites and historical data to find the most suitable prediction method for SoCAB. Ordinary kriging interpolation had the best performance overall for 2020. The model is best at interpolating ozone concentrations inside the sampling region (bounded by the building sites), with R2 ranging from 0.56 to 0.85 for those sites. All interpolation methods poorly predicted and underestimated ozone concentrations for Crestline during summer, indicating that the site has a distribution of ozone concentrations that is independent from all other sites. Therefore, historical data from coastal and inland sites should not be used to predict ozone in Crestline using data-driven spatial interpolation approaches. The study demonstrates the utility of ML and geospatial techniques for evaluating air pollution levels during anomalous periods. Both ML and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model do not fully capture the irregularities caused by emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdown period (March–May) in the SoCAB. Including 2020 training data in the ML model training improves the model's performance and its potential to predict future abnormalities in air quality.},

To support the Global Burden of Disease Study, we produce yearly fine resolution global surface ozone estimates from 1990 to 2017 through a data fusion of observations and models. As ozone observations are sparse in many populated regions, we use a novel combination of the M3Fusion and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) methods. With M3Fusion, we create a multimodel composite by bias-correcting and weighting nine global atmospheric chemistry models based on their ability to predict observations (8834 sites globally) in each region and year. BME is then used to integrate observations, such that estimates match observations at each monitoring site with the observational influence decreasing smoothly across space and time until the output matches the multimodel composite. After estimating at 0.5° resolution using BME, we add fine spatial detail from an additional model, yielding estimates at 0.1° resolution. Observed ozone is predicted more accurately (R2 = 0.81 at the test point, 0.63 at 0.1°, and 0.62 at 0.5°) than the multimodel mean (R2 = 0.28 at 0.5°). Global ozone exposure is estimated to be increasing, driven by highly populated regions of Asia and Africa, despite decreases in the United States and Russia.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

We developed four different computational models, including the generalized additive model (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest, and support vector regression, to develop observation-based relationships between the fourth highest MDA8 ozone in the South Coast Air Basin and precursor emissions, meteorological factors and large-scale climate patterns.

Besides these successes, it becomes clear, that beyond pure prediction, which is the primary strength of most supervised machine learning algorithms, the quantification of uncertainty is relevant and necessary as well. While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic. Drawing parallels between statistical concepts and uncertainty in machine learning, we also demonstrate the role of data and their influence on uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary daytime oxidant in the troposphere and provides the main loss mechanism for many pollutants and greenhouse gases, including methane (CH4). Global mean tropospheric OH differs by as much as 80\% among various global models, for reasons that are not well understood. We use neural networks (NNs), trained using archived output from eight chemical transport models (CTMs) that participated in the Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols and Transport Model Intercomparison Project (POLMIP), to quantify the factors responsible for differences in tropospheric OH and resulting CH4 lifetime (τCH4) between these models. Annual average τCH4, for loss by OH only, ranges from 8.0 to 11.6 years for the eight POLMIP CTMs. The factors driving these differences were quantiﬁed by inputting 3-D chemical ﬁelds from one CTM into the trained NN of another CTM. Across all CTMs, the largest mean differences in τCH4 (ΔτCH4) result from variations in chemical mechanisms (ΔτCH4 = 0.46 years), the photolysis frequency (J) of O3 → O(1D) (0.31 years), local O3 (0.30 years), and CO (0.23 years). The ΔτCH4 due to CTM differences in NOx (NO + NO2) is relatively low (0.17 years), although large regional variation in OH between the CTMs is attributed to NOx. Differences in isoprene and J(NO2) have negligible overall effect on globally averaged tropospheric OH, although the extent of OH variations due to each factor depends on the model being examined. This study demonstrates that NNs can serve as a useful tool for quantifying why tropospheric OH varies between global models, provided that essential chemical ﬁelds are archived.},

	abstract = {Neural networks have become increasingly prevalent within the geosciences, although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backward optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.},

	abstract = {The availability of reliable, high-resolution climate and weather data is important to inform long-term decisions on climate adaptation and mitigation and to guide rapid responses to extreme events. Forecasting models are limited by computational costs and therefore often can only make coarse resolution predictions. Statistical downscaling can provide an efficient method of upsampling low-resolution data. In this field, deep learning has been applied successfully, often using image super-resolution methods from computer vision. Despite achieving visually compelling results in some cases, such models often violate conservation laws when predicting physical variables. In order to conserve important physical quantities, we develop methods that guarantee physical constraints are satisfied by a deep downscaling model while also increasing their performance according to traditional metrics. We introduce two ways of constraining the network: A renormalization layer added to the end of the neural network and a successive approach that scales with increasing upsampling factors. We show the applicability of our methods across different popular architectures and upsampling factors using ERA5 reanalysis data.},

	abstract = {The prediction of tropospheric ozone concentrations is vital due to ozone’s passive impacts on atmosphere, people’s health, flora and fauna. However, ozone prediction is a complex process and the wide range of traditional models is incapable to obtain an accurate prediction. “Artificial intelligence”, “machine learning” and “ozone prediction model” search terms in the title, abstract or keywords are involved. Inclusion criteria include subject area (engineering, computer science), English language and being published from 2015. This criterion obtained 156 articles, which were categorized into 4 areas of interest based on the machine learning technique applied. Recently as a result of the rapid development in the technology and the increase in the number of measured data, artificial intelligence techniques have been intensively used in predicting ozone concentration as an alternative to the traditional models. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the most developed techniques that have been used in predicting ozone concentrations as well as theoretic approaches such as information set approaches, fuzzy set approach and probabilistic set approaches. It is clearly stated that the standalone algorithms such as decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed multilayer perceptron (MLP); however, the latter is massively implemented by many researchers in the prediction of ozone concentrations. This review paper investigated artificial intelligence techniques integrated with optimization approaches. It can be concluded that hybrid algorithms have significantly improved the prediction accuracy. However, the majority of the proposed hybrid models have limitations; thus, there is a need to develop better hybrid algorithm that is able to tackle all the drawbacks of the improved algorithms and capable to capture the ozone concentration changes with a high level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Heat waves and air pollution episodes pose a serious threat to human health and may worsen under future climate change. In this paper, we use 15 years (1999–2013) of commensurately gridded (1° x 1°) surface observations of extended summer (April–September) surface ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and maximum temperature (TX) over the eastern United States and Canada to construct a climatology of the coincidence, overlap, and lag in space and time of their extremes. Extremes of each quantity are defined climatologically at each grid cell as the 50 d with the highest values in three 5-y windows (∼95th percentile). Any two extremes occur on the same day in the same grid cell more than 50\% of the time in the northeastern United States, but on a domain average, co-occurrence is approximately 30\%. Although not exactly co-occurring, many of these extremes show connectedness with consistent offsets in space and in time, which often defy traditional mechanistic explanations. All three extremes occur primarily in large-scale, multiday, spatially connected episodes with scales of {\textgreater}1,000 km and clearly coincide with large-scale meteorological features. The largest, longest-lived episodes have the highest incidence of co-occurrence and contain extreme values well above their local 95th percentile threshold, by +7 ppb for O3, +6 µg m−3 for PM2.5, and +1.7 °C for TX. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate these extremes as synergistic costressors to accurately quantify their impacts on human health.},

	abstract = {Issues regarding air quality and related health concerns have prompted this study, which develops an accurate and computationally fast, efficient hybrid modeling system that combines numerical modeling and machine learning for forecasting concentrations of surface ozone. Currently available numerical modeling systems for air quality predictions (e.g., CMAQ) can forecast 24 to 48 h in advance. In this study, we develop a modeling system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is not only fast but covers a temporal period of two weeks with a resolution as small as a single hour for 255 stations. The CNN model uses meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (processed by the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor), forecasted air quality from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), and previous 24-h concentrations of various measurable air quality parameters as inputs and predicts the following 14-day hourly surface ozone concentrations. The model achieves an average accuracy of 0.91 in terms of the index of agreement for the first day and 0.78 for the fourteenth day, while the average index of agreement for one day ahead prediction from the CMAQ is 0.77. Through this study, we intend to amalgamate the best features of numerical modeling (i.e., fine spatial resolution) and a deep neural network (i.e., computation speed and accuracy) to achieve more accurate spatio-temporal predictions of hourly ozone concentrations. Although the primary purpose of this study is the prediction of hourly ozone concentrations, the system can be extended to various other pollutants.},

In this study, we present a machine learning approach applied to forecasts of the day-ahead maximum value of ozone concentration for several geographical locations in southern Switzerland. Due to the low density of measurement stations and to the complex orography of the use-case terrain, we adopted feature selection methods instead of explicitly restricting relevant features to a neighborhood of the prediction sites, as common in spatio-temporal forecasting methods. We then used Shapley values to assess the explainability of the learned models in terms of feature importance and feature interactions in relation to ozone predictions. Our analysis suggests that the trained models effectively learned explanatory cross-dependencies among atmospheric variables. Finally, we show how weighting observations helps to increase the accuracy of the forecasts for specific ranges of ozone’s daily peak values.},
